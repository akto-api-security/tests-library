id: GRAFANA_XSS
info:
  name: "Grafana Cross-Site Scripting"
  description: "This vulnerability occurs when malicious scripts are injected into the Grafana interface, typically through improperly sanitized user inputs. This allows attackers to execute arbitrary scripts in the browser of an unsuspecting user, leading to actions such as session hijacking, credential theft, or redirection to malicious websites. The vulnerability can impact the confidentiality and security of user sessions within the Grafana environment."
  details: "This vulnerability arises from the failure to adequately sanitize user input in various parts of the application, such as dashboards or plugins. Attackers can exploit this flaw by crafting a malicious payload that, when executed, runs within the context of a logged-in user's session. This can allow the attacker to steal cookies, access sensitive data, or perform actions on behalf of the user. Specific versions affected may vary, making it crucial to keep Grafana updated to mitigate this risk."
  impact: "The impact of this vulnerability can be severe, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary scripts in the context of an affected user's session. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information, session hijacking, and manipulation of user actions. Additionally, it can compromise the integrity of dashboards and potentially spread to other users within the application, resulting in widespread exploitation and data breaches."
