  name: "Jenkins build-metrics Cross-Site Scripting"
  description: "Jenkins build-metrics Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when the plugin fails to properly sanitize user inputs, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts into the Jenkins interface. These scripts can be executed in the browsers of users interacting with the affected plugin, potentially leading to the theft of sensitive information, session hijacking, or unauthorized actions. Secure coding practices and regular updates are crucial to prevent XSS in Jenkins build-metrics."
  details: "Jenkins build-metrics Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities arise when the plugin improperly handles user-supplied data, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts into the Jenkins web interface. These scripts can then run in the browsers of users accessing the build metrics, potentially compromising sensitive information or enabling unauthorized actions. To prevent XSS in the Jenkins build-metrics plugin, it's important to apply input validation, sanitize outputs, and regularly update the plugin with security patches."
  impact: "The impact of Jenkins build-metrics Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities can be serious, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts into the Jenkins interface. This can lead to session hijacking, theft of sensitive information such as credentials, or unauthorized actions performed on behalf of affected users. Additionally, XSS can be exploited to spread malware or escalate attacks, compromising the overall security of the Jenkins environment."
