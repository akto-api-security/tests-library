info:
  name: Citrix Gateway Cross-Site Scripting
  description: "This vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. This can lead to the theft of sensitive information, session hijacking, or redirecting users to malicious websites. The vulnerability exploits weaknesses in Citrix Gateway's input validation, potentially impacting users accessing the service."
  details: "This vulnerability occurs when the application fails to properly sanitize user inputs, allowing attackers to inject malicious JavaScript into the web interface. When other users interact with the compromised page, the malicious script can execute in their browsers. This can result in unauthorized actions such as stealing cookies, session tokens, or redirecting users to phishing sites. The issue typically arises in versions where input validation is inadequate."
  impact: "The impact of this vulnerability can be significant. An attacker can exploit this flaw to inject malicious scripts into the application, leading to unauthorized access to sensitive information such as session cookies, user credentials, or personal data. This could allow the attacker to hijack user sessions, perform actions on behalf of the user, or redirect them to malicious sites, posing serious security risks for affected organizations and users."
