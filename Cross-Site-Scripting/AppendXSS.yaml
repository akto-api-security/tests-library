info:
  name: "XSS by appending to query parameters"
  description: "Testing vulnerability by appending malicious scripts into query parameters to bypass security measures and execute unauthorized code." 
  details: >
            "Security test that aims to identify vulnerabilities in web applications. By appending malicious scripts into query parameters, attackers can bypass security measures and execute unauthorized code on the victim's browser."
            "This test helps developers uncover and address potential XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) vulnerabilities, ensuring robust protection against malicious attacks."
  impact: "An XSS vulnerability can have significant impacts, including the potential for data theft, unauthorized access, session hijacking, defacement of web pages, and the injection of malicious content."
  remediation: "To mitigate XSS by appending to query parameters, implement proper input validation and output encoding. Sanitize user inputs to remove any potentially malicious characters, especially those that could lead to script injection. Utilize security mechanisms like Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the execution of scripts and other potentially harmful content. Additionally, educate developers on secure coding practices to prevent XSS vulnerabilities, and consider using web application firewalls (WAFs) to detect and block malicious input. Regularly update and patch your web application and server to address any known vulnerabilities."
