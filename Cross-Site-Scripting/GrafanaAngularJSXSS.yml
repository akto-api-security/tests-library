info:
  name: "Grafana Angularjs Rendering Cross-Site Scripting"
  description: "This vulnerability affects Grafana applications using AngularJS for rendering. It allows attackers to inject malicious scripts through unvalidated user inputs, which are then executed in the context of the user’s browser. This can lead to session hijacking, data theft, or unauthorized actions performed on behalf of users. Mitigating this vulnerability requires proper input validation and sanitization within the application."
  details: "This vulnerability arises when Grafana improperly sanitizes user inputs in AngularJS components. Attackers can exploit this flaw by crafting malicious payloads that, when rendered, execute arbitrary JavaScript in the browser. This can compromise user sessions or expose sensitive information. Affected versions of Grafana should be updated to apply security patches addressing this issue."
  impact: "The impact of this vulnerability is significant, as it allows attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of a user's browser session. This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information, session hijacking, or phishing attacks. Additionally, compromised user data and the integrity of the application may be at risk, potentially damaging user trust and organizational reputation. Users are advised to upgrade to patched versions of Grafana to mitigate this risk."
