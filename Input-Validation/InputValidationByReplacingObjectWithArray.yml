info:
  name: Input Validation by Replacing Object with Array
  description: >
    This test checks the application's validation mechanisms by replacing expected object structures with arrays.
  details: >
    The test involves sending requests where objects are replaced by arrays to assess whether the application appropriately detects and rejects this structural mismatch.
  impact: >
    Inadequate validation can result in processing errors, security flaws, or the ability to manipulate application logic through unexpected data structures.
