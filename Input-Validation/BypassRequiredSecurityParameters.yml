id: BYPASS_REQUIRED_SECURITY_PARAMETERS
info:
  name: "Bypass Required Security Parameters"
  description: |
    "This test evaluates the system's ability to enforce the presence of required security parameters, such as CVV codes in payment processing, to ensure that sensitive operations are not executed without proper validation. The objective is to identify vulnerabilities that could allow users to bypass critical security checks by omitting or providing invalid security parameters."
  details: |
    "The test involves sending API requests for sensitive operations, such as payments or account modifications, while omitting required security parameters or providing invalid values. For example, a user may attempt to process a payment by leaving out the CVV code or submitting an invalid CVV. The test checks whether the application properly enforces the requirement for all security parameters and rejects requests that do not include or incorrectly provide them."
  impact: |
    "Bypassing required security parameters can lead to increased fraud risk, unauthorized transactions, and potential non-compliance with industry standards, such as PCI DSS for payment processing. If users can omit or manipulate required security parameters like CVV codes, it undermines the integrity of the application's security model and exposes it to various attacks. Ensuring robust validation and enforcement of all required security parameters is critical to maintaining application security and compliance."
