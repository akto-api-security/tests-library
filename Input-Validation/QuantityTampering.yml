info:
  name: "Input Validation test using Quantity Tampering"
  description: >
    "Input Validation testing using Quantity Tampering involves manipulating the quantity field in a form or API request to test how the system handles unexpected or extreme values. This ensures that the application correctly validates and processes input, preventing issues like incorrect pricing, overflow errors, or security vulnerabilities such as injection attacks."
  details: >
    "Quantity Tampering in Input Validation testing targets the manipulation of quantity fields to assess the application's response to altered or malicious input. By testing various scenarios, such as negative values, excessively large numbers, or invalid characters, testers can identify weaknesses in the system's validation logic, ensuring that it accurately enforces business rules and maintains data integrity."
  impact: >
    "The impact of failing to properly validate input during Quantity Tampering tests can be significant, leading to financial losses, data corruption, or security breaches. Exploiting such vulnerabilities could allow attackers to manipulate order totals, bypass pricing rules, or trigger system errors. Ensuring robust validation safeguards the application against these risks, protecting both the business and its customers."
