  name: "Input Validation test using Payment Mode field"
  description: >
    "This test involves checking the payment mode input in a system to ensure it accepts only valid, expected values. This test verifies that the field correctly handles different data types, prevents invalid entries, and ensures that inputs like special characters, empty fields, or incorrect formats are rejected. The goal is to validate that the payment mode field operates securely and accurately, maintaining the integrity of transaction processes."
  details: >
    "This test focuses on testing how well the system validates inputs for payment methods, such as credit card, debit card, PayPal, or other acceptable options. The test ensures that only legitimate and predefined values are accepted while filtering out incorrect formats, special characters, or any unauthorized payment modes. This testing helps prevent errors and potential security vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection or data corruption, by ensuring the input strictly adheres to the allowed parameters. It is crucial for maintaining accurate transaction processing and data integrity in the payment system."
  impact: >
    "Proper input validation of the Payment Mode field significantly impacts the security and reliability of a system. It prevents unauthorized transactions, data breaches, and malicious attacks like SQL injection by ensuring that only valid and expected inputs are processed. This enhances the overall user experience by reducing errors and transaction failures, leading to increased customer trust and satisfaction. Additionally, robust validation safeguards financial data integrity, ensuring compliance with regulatory standards and protecting the organization from potential financial and reputational damage."
