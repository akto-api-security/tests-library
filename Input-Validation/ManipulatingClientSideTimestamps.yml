  name: "Manipulating Client-Side Timestamps"
  description: |
    "This test evaluates the system's ability to properly validate and handle timestamps provided by the client, ensuring that operations based on time are not exploited by manipulating client-side timestamps. The objective is to identify vulnerabilities that could allow users to bypass time-based restrictions, such as expiration dates, rate limits, or access controls, by submitting manipulated timestamps."
  details: |
    "The test involves sending API requests with manipulated client-side timestamps, such as setting a timestamp far in the future (e.g., '2099-12-31T12:00:00Z') or using timestamps that are clearly outside the expected range. For example, a user might attempt to manipulate a timestamp to extend the validity of a session, bypass rate limiting, or gain access to time-sensitive content or functionality. The test checks whether the application properly validates and handles timestamps provided by the client to prevent manipulation."
  impact: |
    "Manipulating client-side timestamps can lead to various security risks, including unauthorized access, bypassing rate limits, extending the validity of expired sessions, or exploiting time-sensitive operations. If users can manipulate timestamps to control the timing of requests, it undermines the integrity of time-based restrictions and application security. Ensuring robust server-side validation and handling of timestamps is crucial to maintain secure and consistent operations and prevent misuse."
