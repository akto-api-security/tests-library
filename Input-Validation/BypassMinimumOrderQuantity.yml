  name: "Bypass Minimum Order Quantity Requirements to Exploit Free Add-Ons"
  description: >
    "This test evaluates the system's ability to properly enforce minimum order quantity requirements for discounts, free add-ons, or promotional offers. The objective is to identify vulnerabilities that could allow users to manipulate order quantities to gain unauthorized benefits, such as free shipping or discounted items, without meeting the minimum required conditions."
  details: >
    "The test involves sending API requests with manipulated product quantities and total amounts to check if the system accurately validates the minimum order requirements. For example, users may attempt to add low-cost items to artificially inflate the total order amount and qualify for free add-ons or discounts. The test checks whether the application enforces the rules correctly to prevent users from exploiting minimum order quantity thresholds to access promotional benefits without meeting the genuine requirements."
  impact: >
    "Bypassing minimum order quantity requirements can lead to financial losses, abuse of promotional offers, and unfair advantages for certain users. If users can manipulate order quantities to gain unauthorized discounts or free add-ons, it undermines the integrity of the promotions and impacts the business's profitability. Ensuring robust validation of minimum order requirements is crucial to maintain fair pricing strategies, protect revenue, and prevent exploitation of promotional offers."
