info:
  name: Dummy Content-Length Header
  description: |
    "This vulnerability arises when an application does not properly validate or handle Content-Length headers in HTTP requests, potentially allowing for exploitation through malformed or unexpected header values."
  details: |
    "By sending a dummy Content-Length header with a non-numeric value, such as 'cats', an attacker can iteratively test all paths and HTTP methods of the application. The objective is to provoke a response from the server that indicates how it handles invalid content length values. The expectation is to receive a 400 Bad Request response, indicating that the server correctly rejects unsupported Content-Length formats."
  impact: |
    "Improper handling of Content-Length headers can lead to various issues, including request misprocessing, buffer overflow vulnerabilities, or denial of service. If the server fails to respond with a 400 Bad Request, it may suggest vulnerabilities in the application's request parsing logic or improper input validation mechanisms."
