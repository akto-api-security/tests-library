id: BYPASS_PRODUCT_RETURN_VALIDATION
info:
  name: "Bypass Product Return Validation"
  description: |
    "This test evaluates the system's ability to handle and validate product return requests properly, ensuring that returns and refunds are processed only once per valid transaction. The objective is to identify vulnerabilities that could allow users to abuse return policies by submitting multiple refund requests for the same order."
  details: |
    "The test involves sending API requests to initiate multiple return or refund requests for the same order and product, using different reasons or without altering any data. For example, users might attempt to claim a refund for a product marked as 'defective' multiple times to receive multiple refunds or submit returns for different items from the same order without proper validation checks. The test checks whether the application correctly enforces return validation rules to prevent repeated refunds for the same transaction or unauthorized returns."
  impact: |
    "Bypassing product return validation can lead to significant financial losses, fraudulent refund claims, and abuse of return policies. If users can manipulate return processes to receive multiple refunds for the same purchase or exploit lenient validation checks, it undermines the business's financial stability and trust in its return policies. Ensuring robust validation of product returns and refunds is crucial to prevent exploitation, maintain fair return policies, and protect against potential fraud."
