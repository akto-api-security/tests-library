  name: Exploit Referral Programs
  description: |
    "This test evaluates the potential for exploiting referral programs within an application by manipulating referral codes to gain unauthorized rewards or benefits. The objective is to identify weaknesses in the referral system that may allow users to abuse or exploit referral codes for undeserved rewards."
  details: |
    "The test involves sending API requests with modified or multiple referral codes to observe how the system processes these inputs. For instance, it checks if submitting a single referral code (`REF123`) grants a reward of `10`, and if using multiple codes (`REF123,REF456,REF789`) incorrectly accumulates a higher reward of `30`. By testing various combinations and scenarios, the test aims to identify if the referral system properly validates and applies referral codes without granting excess rewards or allowing manipulation."
  impact: |
    "Exploiting referral programs can lead to financial losses and reward abuse, as users might gain unauthorized benefits or rewards through manipulation. This could result in increased costs for the company, unfair advantages for certain users, and potential damage to the referral program's integrity. Ensuring robust validation and handling of referral codes is crucial to prevent exploitation, maintain program fairness, and protect the company's financial interests."
