info:
  name: "Bypass Cashback Validation"
  description: |
    "This test evaluates the system's ability to correctly handle and validate cashback calculations, ensuring that users cannot manipulate transactions to receive unintended or excessive cashback rewards. The objective is to identify vulnerabilities that could allow users to bypass the proper validation of cashback amounts, leading to fraudulent or unauthorized cashback credits."
  details: |
    "The test involves sending API requests with manipulated parameters related to cashback calculations, such as adjusting the cashback amount or adding unauthorized fields. For example, a user might attempt to inflate the 'cashback_awarded' value far beyond the permitted limit or modify the request to include additional cashback conditions. The test checks whether the application enforces correct cashback rules and calculations, ensuring that all awarded amounts are accurately validated and comply with the applicable policies."
  impact: |
    "Bypassing cashback validation can result in financial losses, abuse of promotional offers, and unfair advantages for certain users. If users can manipulate cashback amounts to receive more than they are entitled to, it undermines promotional strategies, affects profitability, and can lead to potential fraud. Ensuring robust validation of cashback calculations is crucial to maintain fair use of rewards programs, protect revenue, and prevent exploitation of cashback policies."
