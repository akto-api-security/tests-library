id: BYPASS_MINIMUM_SPEND_VALIDATION
info:
  name: "Bypass Minimum Spend Validation"
  description: |
    "This test assesses whether the system correctly enforces minimum spend requirements for promotions or discounts. The objective is to determine if users can manipulate their order details to bypass the minimum spend threshold needed to qualify for certain offers."
  details: |
    "The test involves modifying order details to simulate attempts to bypass the minimum spend validation."
  impact: |
    "Bypassing minimum spend validation can lead to significant revenue loss and abuse of promotional offers. If users can manipulate their order details to qualify for discounts without meeting the actual spending criteria, it undermines the effectiveness of promotional strategies and devalues the offers. This can lead to financial losses and damage to the brand's integrity. Ensuring robust validation of minimum spend requirements is essential to prevent misuse, protect revenues, and maintain fair business practices."
