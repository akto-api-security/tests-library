  name: "Manipulating Reward/Cashback/User Points Multiplier"
  description: >
    "This test evaluates the system's ability to handle and validate the points multiplier applied to reward or cashback points during transactions. The objective is to identify vulnerabilities that could allow users to manipulate the multiplier values to earn more points than intended."
  details: >
    "The test involves sending API requests with different `pointsMultiplier` values to check if the system properly validates and enforces the correct multipliers based on the transaction or promotional criteria. For example, during a standard transaction, a multiplier of '1x' might be valid, while a higher multiplier such as '3x' could only be allowed during special promotions or specific conditions. The test checks whether the application accurately restricts and validates the use of points multipliers to prevent unauthorized or excessive accumulation of reward points."
  impact: >
    "Improper handling of points multipliers can lead to significant financial losses and fraudulent use of promotional campaigns. If users can manipulate the multiplier to earn more points than intended, it undermines the integrity of the rewards program, increases the risk of financial abuse, and diminishes the value of genuine promotions. Ensuring robust validation of points multipliers is crucial to maintain fair rewards distribution, protect against fraud, and uphold the credibility of the loyalty program."
