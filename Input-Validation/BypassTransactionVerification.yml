id: BYPASS_TRANSACTION_VERIFICATION
info:
  name: "Bypassing User Verification on Transaction APIs"
  description: |
    "This test assesses the ability to bypass user verification requirements in transaction APIs. The goal is to determine if it's possible to execute transactions without proper verification, which should normally be a mandatory step for high-value or sensitive transactions."
  details: |
    "The test involves initiating transactions with verification requirements enabled and then attempting to bypass the verification step."
  impact: |
    "Bypassing user verification can have severe security implications, including unauthorized transactions and potential fraud. If users can bypass verification for high-value or sensitive transactions, it exposes the system to significant financial and security risks. This could result in unauthorized access to funds, financial losses, and damage to the company's reputation. Ensuring robust verification mechanisms are in place and enforced is crucial to safeguarding transaction integrity and preventing abuse."
