info:
  name: "Bypass Minimum Password Requirements"
  description: |
    "This test evaluates the system's ability to enforce minimum password requirements, such as length, complexity, and character variety, to ensure that users cannot create accounts with weak passwords. The objective is to identify vulnerabilities that could allow users to bypass password strength policies, leading to insecure accounts susceptible to attacks."
  details: |
    "The test involves sending API requests with weak passwords that do not meet the minimum requirements, such as those with insufficient length or missing special characters. For example, a user might attempt to register with a password like '123' or 'password' to check if the application accepts it despite lacking complexity. The test checks whether the application correctly enforces password policies and rejects weak passwords to prevent account compromise."
  impact: |
    "Bypassing minimum password requirements can lead to insecure accounts that are easily compromised by brute-force or dictionary attacks. If users are allowed to register with weak passwords, it increases the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches, undermining the security of the application and its users. Ensuring robust enforcement of password strength requirements is crucial to maintaining account security and protecting user data."
