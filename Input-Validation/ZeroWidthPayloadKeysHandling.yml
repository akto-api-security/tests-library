id: ZERO_WIDTH_PAYLOAD_KEYS_HANDLING
info:
  name: "Zero Width Payload Keys Handling"
  description: |
    This test evaluates how the application processes and handles payload keys that contain zero-width characters, which can be used to bypass validation checks and exploit potential vulnerabilities.
  details: |
    The test involves sending payloads with zero-width characters in the keys to assess whether the application properly validates and sanitizes these keys, and to observe how the application behaves when such keys are present.
  impact: |
    Improper handling of zero-width characters in payload keys can lead to unexpected behavior, bypassing of security controls, or data integrity issues, potentially allowing for exploitation or manipulation of application logic.
