id: BYPASS_ORDER_DEPOSIT_VALIDATION
info:
  name: "Bypass Deposit Validation for Orders and Pre-Orders"
  description: |
    "This test examines the ability to bypass the deposit validation mechanism for orders and pre-orders. The objective is to determine whether users can manipulate the deposit amount to secure a reservation or pre-order a product without meeting the required deposit criteria."
  details: |
    "The test involves sending API requests with different values to check if the system accurately validates the deposit requirement before confirming an order or reservation."
  impact: |
    "Bypassing deposit validation can lead to potential financial losses and inventory management issues. If users are able to secure reservations or pre-orders without providing the correct deposit, it could result in unpaid or incomplete transactions, reduced inventory control, and abuse of the ordering system. Ensuring proper validation and enforcement of deposit requirements is crucial to maintaining financial integrity, protecting against fraudulent activity, and ensuring fair business practices."
