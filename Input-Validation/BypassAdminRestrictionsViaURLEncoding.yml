info:
  name: Bypass Admin Restrictions via URL Encoding
  description: >
    "This issue arises when access control mechanisms for sensitive areas, such as admin panels, are not properly enforced. Attackers can manipulate URLs using URL encoding to bypass restrictions and gain unauthorized access to admin or restricted sections of a website."
  details: >
    "By encoding certain characters in the URL, attackers can bypass access controls that are applied to specific paths. The server may not correctly decode the URL or enforce restrictions, leading to unauthorized access to protected resources. URL encoding can be used to evade path-based security mechanisms, particularly when there is insufficient validation or sanitization of the requested URL."
  impact: >
    "By exploiting URL encoding to bypass access controls, attackers can gain unauthorized access to sensitive areas of the website, such as admin panels. This can lead to severe consequences, including the ability to modify, delete, or steal sensitive data, compromise the system, or escalate privileges."
