  name: "Manipulate Subscription Add-On Handling"
  description: >
    "This test evaluates the system's ability to correctly manage and validate the addition of subscription add-ons, particularly when users attempt to exploit the process to gain unauthorized access to extra features without paying for a higher-tier subscription. The objective is to identify vulnerabilities that could allow users to add premium features without upgrading their subscription plan."
  details: >
    "The test involves sending API requests with manipulated parameters related to subscription add-ons, such as adding both 'basic' and 'premium' support features under a lower-tier subscription. For example, a user may try to combine add-ons meant for different subscription levels to gain additional benefits without proper authorization or payment. The test checks whether the application enforces subscription rules correctly, ensuring that users cannot bypass add-on restrictions or access features they are not entitled to."
  impact: >
    "Manipulating subscription add-ons can lead to revenue loss, abuse of service features, and unfair advantages for certain users. If users can gain unauthorized access to higher-tier features by exploiting add-on management processes, it undermines the subscription model and affects profitability. Ensuring robust validation of add-on handling is crucial to maintaining fair subscription practices, protecting revenue, and preventing abuse of service features."
