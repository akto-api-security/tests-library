  name: "Manipulating Time Frequency"
  description: |
    "This test evaluates the system's ability to correctly handle and validate time-based frequency settings, particularly in scenarios involving automated reorders or subscriptions. The objective is to identify vulnerabilities that could allow users to manipulate reorder frequencies to repeatedly trigger discounts or benefits without adhering to the intended usage patterns."
  details: |
    "The test involves sending API requests with varying time frequency parameters, such as 'daily', 'weekly', or 'monthly', to check if the system correctly validates the frequency and applies discounts or benefits appropriately. For example, a user might attempt to change the reorder frequency from 'monthly' to 'daily' to exploit discounts meant for longer intervals, without completing prior orders. The test checks whether the application enforces time frequency validation rules, preventing unauthorized or excessive benefits from being applied."
  impact: |
    "Manipulating time frequency settings can lead to financial losses, abuse of promotional discounts, and unfair advantages for certain users. If users can repeatedly trigger discounts or benefits by altering reorder frequencies without completing prior orders, it undermines the integrity of discount strategies and affects profitability. Ensuring robust validation of time frequency settings is crucial to maintaining fair promotional practices, protecting revenue, and preventing exploitation of automated reorder systems."
