  name: "Manipulate Inventory Stock"
  description: >
    "This test evaluates how the application handles and manages inventory stock levels, particularly focusing on the ability to manipulate stock quantities through API requests. The objective is to identify potential vulnerabilities or flaws that may allow unauthorized changes to inventory stock, affecting product availability and order fulfillment."
  details: >
    "The test involves modifying inventory stock levels by sending different API requests to check how the system responds. For example, the test checks the available quantity of a product and then sends a request to reserve a certain quantity of that product. By verifying that the system accurately reflects changes in stock, such as updating available quantities and reserved quantities, the test ensures that inventory management functions correctly. The test aims to uncover any weaknesses in how the application processes stock changes and manages product availability."
  impact: >
    "Improper handling of inventory stock can lead to significant issues, such as overselling products, stock discrepancies, and financial losses. If an attacker or user can manipulate stock quantities, they might exploit the system to reserve or alter stock levels fraudulently, causing inventory mismanagement and impacting order fulfillment. This could result in customer dissatisfaction, revenue loss, and damage to the company's reputation. Ensuring robust inventory management and validation processes is crucial to maintaining accurate stock levels and operational efficiency."
