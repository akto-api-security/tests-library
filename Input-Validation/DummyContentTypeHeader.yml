id: DUMMY_CONTENT_TYPE_HEADER
info:
  name: Dummy Content-Type Header
  description: |
    "This vulnerability involves the improper handling of the Content-Type HTTP header, which specifies the media type of the resource being sent in the request. When applications do not validate or restrict Content-Type values, they may be susceptible to various injection attacks."
  details: |
    "By sending a dummy Content-Type header with a nonsensical or malformed value (e.g., 'application/cats'), an attacker can test how the server processes requests with unexpected media types. This can reveal weaknesses in input validation and error handling mechanisms. The goal is to observe the server's response to determine if it can be exploited through content-type manipulation."
  impact: |
    "If the server accepts invalid Content-Type values, it could lead to vulnerabilities such as arbitrary code execution, data injection, or denial of service. Proper validation and handling of Content-Type headers are crucial to maintain the integrity and security of web applications."
