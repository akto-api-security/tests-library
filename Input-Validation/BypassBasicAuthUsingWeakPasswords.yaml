info:
  name: Bypass Basic Auth Using Weak Passwords
  description: |
    "This vulnerability arises when basic authentication is used to protect sensitive resources, but weak or easily guessable credentials are implemented. Attackers can perform brute-force or dictionary attacks to bypass authentication and access restricted areas."
  details: |
    "Basic authentication encodes the username and password in Base64 format and sends them in the request headers. If weak credentials, such as 'admin:password,' are used, attackers can easily bypass authentication by decoding the Base64-encoded string or attempting common passwords through brute-force attacks."
  impact: |
    "By exploiting weak credentials in basic authentication, attackers can gain unauthorized access to sensitive resources, allowing them to manipulate data, steal confidential information, or perform other malicious activities. This can result in data breaches, system compromise, and unauthorized access to admin functionalities."
