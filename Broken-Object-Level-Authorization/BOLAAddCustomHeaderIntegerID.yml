info:
  name: "Exploiting BOLA by adding Custom Header with Integer IDs for Unauthorized Access."
  description: > 
    "In this exploitation scenario, attackers target Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA) 
    by adding custom headers with Integer IDs to their requests, attempting to gain unauthorized access. 
    By manipulating request headers, adversaries seek to exploit weaknesses in authorization 
    mechanisms, potentially bypassing security controls. This method underscores the need 
    for thorough security assessments, emphasizing the importance of secure header handling 
    and robust access controls to mitigate the risks associated with unauthorized access and 
    BOLA vulnerabilities."
  details: >
    "Attackers exploit Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA) by adding custom headers to 
    their requests, attempting unauthorized access. Manipulating headers aims to exploit 
    vulnerabilities in the system's authorization mechanisms, highlighting the need for 
    robust security assessments and secure header handling. Thorough security measures 
    are essential to prevent unauthorized access, addressing the risks associated with 
    BOLA vulnerabilities and custom header manipulation."
  impact: >
    "Exploiting Broken Object Level Authorization by adding custom headers can have a profound 
    impact, potentially leading to unauthorized access and compromise of sensitive data. 
    Successful manipulation may enable malicious actions within the system, emphasizing 
    the critical need for stringent security measures, robust access controls, and 
    secure handling of custom headers to prevent and mitigate the risks associated with
    Broken Object Level Authorization vulnerabilities."
  remediation: "To remediate BOLA vulnerabilities exploited through custom headers with Integer IDs, enforce strict server-side authorization checks for all requests. Validate user permissions independently of header values and ensure robust access control mechanisms are in place to prevent unauthorized access."
