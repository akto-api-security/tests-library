info:
  name: "Exploiting BOLA by replacing URL path with Integer IDs for Unauthorized Access."
  description: >
    "In this specific test, attackers attempt unauthorized access by substituting  Integer IDs in the URL path. By doing so, the test aims to uncover weaknesses  in the authorization mechanisms, revealing potential security lapses in how  the application manages user privileges and access controls."
  details: >
    "This test aims to uncover vulnerabilities in applications relying on user-input like  URL paths for access control. By substituting Integer IDs in the URL path, attackers  exploit this weakness to gain unauthorized access. This test helps identify and  rectify flaws in authorization mechanisms, exposing potential security risks in  managing user privileges and access controls."
  impact: >
    "Manipulating Integer IDs in URL paths to exploit Broken Object Level Authorization  (BOLA) can result in significant impacts. Unauthorized access may lead to data  breaches, compromising sensitive information and user privacy. This security  vulnerability not only jeopardizes the application's reputation but also exposes  it to legal consequences. Effectively addressing BOLA is crucial for preventing  these severe repercussions and ensuring the overall security of the system."
