info:
  name: "Exploiting BOLA by replacing URL path with Integer IDs for Unauthorized Access."
  description: > 
    "In this specific test, attackers attempt unauthorized access by substituting 
    Integer IDs in the URL path. By doing so, the test aims to uncover weaknesses 
    in the authorization mechanisms, revealing potential security lapses in how 
    the application manages user privileges and access controls."
  details: >
    "This test aims to uncover vulnerabilities in applications relying on user-input like 
    URL paths for access control. By substituting Integer IDs in the URL path, attackers 
    exploit this weakness to gain unauthorized access. This test helps identify and 
    rectify flaws in authorization mechanisms, exposing potential security risks in 
    managing user privileges and access controls."
  impact: >
    "Manipulating Integer IDs in URL paths to exploit Broken Object Level Authorization 
    (BOLA) can result in significant impacts. Unauthorized access may lead to data 
    breaches, compromising sensitive information and user privacy. This security 
    vulnerability not only jeopardizes the application's reputation but also exposes 
    it to legal consequences. Effectively addressing BOLA is crucial for preventing 
    these severe repercussions and ensuring the overall security of the system."
  remediation: "To mitigate unauthorized access attempts via Integer ID substitution in the URL path, strengthen server-side authorization mechanisms. Implement robust validation to ensure that only authorized users can access resources regardless of the IDs provided in the URL. Enhance user privilege management and access controls to address weaknesses in the authorization process and prevent potential security lapses."
