info:
  name: "Exploiting BOLA by fuzzing Custom Header with Integer for Unauthorized Access with DELETE based APIs"
  description: >
    "Attackers exploit Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA) by employing header fuzzing techniques with Integer, systematically testing variations to gain unauthorized access (for DELETE based APIs). This method highlights vulnerabilities in the system's authorization mechanisms,  underscoring the importance of robust security assessments, secure header handling with Integer, and comprehensive testing to mitigate the risks associated with unauthorized access and BOLA vulnerabilities introduced through custom header manipulation."

  impact: >
    "The impact of exploiting Broken Object Level Authorization through custom header fuzzing can be significant. Successful manipulation may lead to unauthorized access, potentially compromising sensitive data and enabling malicious actions within the system. This method underscores the critical importance of implementing stringent security measures, including robust access controls, secure header handling, and thorough testing, to prevent unauthorized access and mitigate the risks associated with Broken Object Level Authorization vulnerabilities introduced through custom header fuzzing."
