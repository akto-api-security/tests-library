  name: "Exploiting BOLA: Direct System Operation Using Integer Parameter Values"
  description: > 
    "In this instance of Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA), attackers exploit system 
    vulnerabilities by directly utilizing integer parameter values to perform operations. This 
    manipulation poses a significant risk, potentially bypassing authorization controls and 
    compromising the system's integrity. It underscores the imperative for stringent input 
    validation and secure object-level authorization practices to mitigate these risks 
    effectively. Addressing such vulnerabilities promptly is crucial for preventing 
    unauthorized system operations and ensuring robust security measures."

    "In the context of Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA), this scenario involves 
    attackers exploiting vulnerabilities by directly employing integer parameter values 
    to execute operations within the system. By manipulating these parameters, adversaries 
    may bypass authorization controls, posing a substantial risk to the system's integrity. 
    Robust input validation and secure object-level authorization practices are imperative 
    to mitigate these vulnerabilities effectively and prevent unauthorized system operations."
  impact: >
    "The impact of exploiting Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA) through direct 
    utilization of integer parameter values for system operations can be severe. Successful 
    manipulation may lead to unauthorized access, compromising sensitive data and potentially 
    causing system disruptions. Addressing these vulnerabilities promptly is essential to 
    prevent unauthorized operations, safeguard against data breaches, and uphold the overall 
    security posture of the system."
