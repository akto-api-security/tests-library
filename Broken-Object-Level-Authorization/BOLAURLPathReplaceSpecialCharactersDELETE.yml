info:
  name: "Exploiting BOLA by replacing URL path with Special Characters for Unauthorized Access with DELETE based APIs"
  description: >
    "This BOLA test (with DELETE based APIs) focuses on manipulating URL paths with special characters to exploit vulnerabilities. This tactic aims to achieve unauthorized access by tricking the system  into accepting unconventional input, compromising object-level authorization controls. Attackers, by replacing standard URL components, seek to breach security measures, potentially leading to unauthorized entry and exposure of sensitive resources within  the application."
  details: >
    "This BOLA test (with DELETE based APIs) exploits vulnerabilities in an application's authorization by substituting special characters in the URL path. This manipulation aims at gaining unauthorized access by circumventing object-level authorization controls. Attackers employ this technique to trick the system, potentially compromising security  and enabling access to restricted resources, posing a threat of unauthorized exposure of sensitive data within the application."
  impact: >
    "The impact of a successful BOLA attack can be severe, as it allows unauthorized access to sensitive resources within the application. This breach compromises the confidentiality and integrity of data, potentially leading to data leaks or manipulation. Moreover, it undermines the overall security posture of the system, exposing vulnerabilities that can be exploited for further malicious activities, putting both the application and its users at significant risk."
