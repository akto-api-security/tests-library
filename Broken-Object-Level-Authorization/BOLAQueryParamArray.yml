  name: "BOLA: Turning Query Parameters into Arrays for Unauthorized Access"
  description: > 
    "With this test, attackers manipulate the system by wrapping query parameters as arrays, 
    aiming to exploit vulnerabilities and gain unauthorized access. By transforming these parameters, 
    adversaries seek to circumvent security measures and potentially compromise the integrity of 
    the system. This method underscores the importance of secure input handling and highlights 
    the risks associated with BOLA abuse, emphasizing the need for robust security 
    practices to thwart such unauthorized access attempts."
  details: >
    "In this test, attackers exploit BOLA vulnerabilities by manipulating query parameters, 
    transforming them into arrays. This manipulation aims to bypass security measures, 
    potentially leading to unauthorized access and compromises in system integrity. 
    Understanding and mitigating these risks is essential for maintaining robust security 
    practices and preventing unauthorized access through exploitation of BOLA vulnerabilities."
  impact: >
    "The impact of this test can be severe, introducing the risk of unauthorized access 
    and compromising system integrity. By exploiting BOLA vulnerabilities, attackers may 
    gain unauthorized entry, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized disclosures, 
    and a degradation of overall system security. Addressing and mitigating these 
    vulnerabilities promptly is crucial to prevent unauthorized access and protect 
    the system from potential exploitation."
