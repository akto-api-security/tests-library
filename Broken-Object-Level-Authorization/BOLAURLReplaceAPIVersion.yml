id: BOLA_URL_REPLACE_API_VERSION
info:
  name: "Exploiting BOLA by replacing URL path with API Version IDs for Unauthorized Access."
  description: > 
    "This test involves exploiting security vulnerabilities by manipulating the URL 
    path with API Version IDs to gain unauthorized access. In this scenario, 
    attackers leverage BOLA to compromise the system by replacing the URL path, 
    tricking the system into granting access to sensitive data or functionalities 
    without proper authorization. This test aims to identify and rectify weaknesses 
    in object-level authorization mechanisms to ensure robust security measures 
    against unauthorized access attempts."
  details: >
    "This test focuses on identifying vulnerabilities where attackers manipulate URL 
    paths by substituting them with API Version IDs. This manipulation allows 
    unauthorized access to sensitive information or functionalities within a 
    system. By exploiting BOLA, attackers can circumvent proper authorization 
    mechanisms, posing a significant security risk. Conducting this test helps 
    organizations identify and address weaknesses in object-level authorization, 
    enhancing overall system security."
  impact: >
    "Exploiting Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA) through the manipulation of 
    URL paths can have severe impacts on system security. Unauthorized access to 
    sensitive data or functionalities may lead to unauthorized disclosure, 
    alteration, or deletion of critical information. This security vulnerability 
    could result in a compromise of user privacy, financial losses, and reputational 
    damage for the affected organization. Addressing BOLA vulnerabilities is crucial 
    to mitigate these potential impacts and maintain the integrity of the system."
