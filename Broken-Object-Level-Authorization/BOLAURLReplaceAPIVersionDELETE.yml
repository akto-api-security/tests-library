info:
  name: "Exploiting BOLA by replacing URL path with API Version IDs for Unauthorized Access for DELETE based APIs"
  description: >
    "This test (for DELETE based APIs) involves exploiting security vulnerabilities by manipulating the URL path with API Version IDs to gain unauthorized access. In this scenario, attackers leverage BOLA to compromise the system by replacing the URL path, tricking the system into granting access to sensitive data or functionalities without proper authorization. This test aims to identify and rectify weaknesses in object-level authorization mechanisms to ensure robust security measures against unauthorized access attempts."
  details: >
    "This test (for DELETE based APIs) focuses on identifying vulnerabilities where attackers manipulate URL paths by substituting them with API Version IDs. This manipulation allows unauthorized access to sensitive information or functionalities within a system. By exploiting BOLA, attackers can circumvent proper authorization mechanisms, posing a significant security risk. Conducting this test helps organizations identify and address weaknesses in object-level authorization, enhancing overall system security."
  impact: >
    "Exploiting Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA) through the manipulation of URL paths can have severe impacts on system security. Unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionalities may lead to unauthorized disclosure, alteration, or deletion of critical information. This security vulnerability could result in a compromise of user privacy, financial losses, and reputational damage for the affected organization. Addressing BOLA vulnerabilities is crucial  to mitigate these potential impacts and maintain the integrity of the system."
