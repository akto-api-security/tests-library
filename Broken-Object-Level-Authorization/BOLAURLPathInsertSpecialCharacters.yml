info:
  name: "Exploiting BOLA by inserting Special Characters in URL path for Unauthorized Access."
  description: > 
    "In this BOLA test, attackers exploit vulnerabilities by 
    inserting special characters into the URL path, attempting unauthorized access. This 
    method focuses on flaws in object-level authorization, enabling attackers to manipulate 
    URLs and bypass access controls. By strategically using special characters, the test 
    emulates unauthorized access attempts, exposing weaknesses in the authorization 
    process for organizations to address and enhance their system's security."
  details: >
    "This BOLA test involves probing for security weaknesses by inserting special 
    characters into URL paths. This simulated attack aims to exploit vulnerabilities 
    in object-level authorization, allowing unauthorized access. Attackers manipulate 
    the URL structure to bypass access controls, revealing potential flaws in the 
    authorization process. This test helps organizations identify and rectify security 
    risks associated with object-level authorization mechanisms."
  impact: >
    "Exploiting BOLA through special character insertion can have severe 
    impacts. Unauthorized access to sensitive objects may lead to data breaches, 
    exposing confidential information. Attackers could manipulate or delete critical 
    data, disrupting business operations and causing reputational damage. Organizations 
    must address BOLA vulnerabilities promptly to prevent these potential impacts 
    on data integrity, privacy, and overall system security."
