id: BOLA_URL_INSERT_SPECIAL_CHAR
info:
  name: "Exploiting BOLA by inserting Special Characters in URL path for Unauthorized Access."
  description: >
    "In this BOLA test, attackers exploit vulnerabilities by  inserting special characters into the URL path, attempting unauthorized access. This  method focuses on flaws in object-level authorization, enabling attackers to manipulate  URLs and bypass access controls. By strategically using special characters, the test  emulates unauthorized access attempts, exposing weaknesses in the authorization  process for organizations to address and enhance their system's security."
  details: >
    "This BOLA test involves probing for security weaknesses by inserting special  characters into URL paths. This simulated attack aims to exploit vulnerabilities  in object-level authorization, allowing unauthorized access. Attackers manipulate  the URL structure to bypass access controls, revealing potential flaws in the  authorization process. This test helps organizations identify and rectify security  risks associated with object-level authorization mechanisms."
  impact: >
    "Exploiting BOLA through special character insertion can have severe  impacts. Unauthorized access to sensitive objects may lead to data breaches,  exposing confidential information. Attackers could manipulate or delete critical  data, disrupting business operations and causing reputational damage. Organizations  must address BOLA vulnerabilities promptly to prevent these potential impacts  on data integrity, privacy, and overall system security."
