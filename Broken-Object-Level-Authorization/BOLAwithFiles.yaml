  name: "BOLA by Accessing Files of other Users"
  description: > 
    "This specific test of Broken object level authorization occurs when a user gains unauthorized 
    access to files belonging to other users within a system. This security vulnerability allows 
    an attacker to exploit weaknesses in the object-level permissions, bypassing proper access 
    controls. By doing so, the attacker can compromise the confidentiality and integrity of 
    sensitive information stored in files, potentially leading to unauthorized data disclosure 
    or manipulation."
  details: >
    "This type of Broken object level authorization refers to a security flaw where an attacker 
    gains unauthorized access to files belonging to different users within a system. This 
    typically happens when object-level permissions are inadequately enforced, allowing an 
    attacker to bypass access controls and access files they shouldn't. Exploiting this 
    vulnerability can result in unauthorized data access, potentially compromising sensitive 
    information and violating data confidentiality and integrity."
  impact: >
    "The impact of broken object level authorization can be severe, leading to unauthorized 
    access and exposure of sensitive information stored in files. Attackers exploiting this 
    vulnerability can compromise data confidentiality, potentially leading to privacy breaches 
    and unauthorized disclosure of personal or confidential data. Additionally, the integrity 
    of the data may be at risk, as attackers could manipulate or corrupt files, posing a threat 
    to the overall reliability and trustworthiness of the affected system."
