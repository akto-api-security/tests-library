info:
  name: "Exploiting BOLA by replacing URL path with Special Characters for Unauthorized Access."
  description: > 
    "This BOLA test focuses on manipulating URL paths with special characters to exploit 
    vulnerabilities. This tactic aims to achieve unauthorized access by tricking the system 
    into accepting unconventional input, compromising object-level authorization controls. 
    Attackers, by replacing standard URL components, seek to breach security measures, 
    potentially leading to unauthorized entry and exposure of sensitive resources within 
    the application."
  details: >
    "This BOLA test exploits vulnerabilities in an application's authorization by 
    substituting special characters in the URL path. This manipulation aims at 
    gaining unauthorized access by circumventing object-level authorization controls. 
    Attackers employ this technique to trick the system, potentially compromising security 
    and enabling access to restricted resources, posing a threat of unauthorized exposure 
    of sensitive data within the application."
  impact: >
    "The impact of a successful BOLA attack can be severe, as it allows unauthorized 
    access to sensitive resources within the application. This breach compromises the 
    confidentiality and integrity of data, potentially leading to data leaks or 
    manipulation. Moreover, it undermines the overall security posture of the system, 
    exposing vulnerabilities that can be exploited for further malicious activities, 
    putting both the application and its users at significant risk."
