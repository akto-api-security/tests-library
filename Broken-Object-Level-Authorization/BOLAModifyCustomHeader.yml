  name: "Exploiting BOLA by fuzzing Custom Header for Unauthorized Access."
  description: > 
    "Attackers exploit Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA) by employing header fuzzing 
    techniques, systematically testing variations to gain unauthorized access. This method 
    highlights vulnerabilities in the system's authorization mechanisms, underscoring the 
    importance of robust security assessments, secure header handling, and comprehensive 
    testing to mitigate the risks associated with unauthorized access and BOLA vulnerabilities 
    introduced through custom header manipulation."

  impact: >
    "The impact of exploiting Broken Object Level Authorization through custom header fuzzing can 
    be significant. Successful manipulation may lead to unauthorized access, potentially 
    compromising sensitive data and enabling malicious actions within the system. This 
    method underscores the critical importance of implementing stringent security measures, 
    including robust access controls, secure header handling, and thorough testing, to 
    prevent unauthorized access and mitigate the risks associated with Broken Object 
    Level Authorization vulnerabilities introduced through custom header fuzzing."
