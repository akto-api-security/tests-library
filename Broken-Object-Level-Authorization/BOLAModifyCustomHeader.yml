  name: "Exploiting BOLA by fuzzing Custom Header for Unauthorized Access."
  description: >
    "Attackers exploit Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA) by employing header fuzzing  techniques, systematically testing variations to gain unauthorized access. This method  highlights vulnerabilities in the system's authorization mechanisms, underscoring the  importance of robust security assessments, secure header handling, and comprehensive  testing to mitigate the risks associated with unauthorized access and BOLA vulnerabilities  introduced through custom header manipulation."
