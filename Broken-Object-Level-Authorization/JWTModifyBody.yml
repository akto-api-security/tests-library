  name: "JWT Token Tampering: Modifying User IDs for Potential Unauthorized Access."
  description: > 
    "JWT Token Tampering involves assessing security risks by identifying and modifying user 
    IDs within tokens. By manipulating JWT tokens on jwt.io and substituting the user ID, 
    this method aims to test the system's resilience against unauthorized access attempts. 
    The evaluation helps identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities, ensuring the 
    integrity of user data and overall system security."
  details: >
    "In this test, attackers attempt to manipulate JSON Web Tokens (JWT) by identifying user 
    IDs and substituting them with new ones on jwt.io. This method serves as a security test 
    to gauge the system's vulnerability to unauthorized access. By evaluating the system's 
    response to tampered JWT tokens, organizations can identify and address potential 
    weaknesses, enhancing overall security against unauthorized data access through token manipulation."
  impact: >
    "The impact of this test is significant, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive
     user data. Successful tampering could compromise the integrity of the authentication system, 
     allowing attackers to access information belonging to other users. Promptly addressing and 
     mitigating these vulnerabilities is crucial to maintaining the security and trustworthiness 
     of systems relying on JWT tokens for user authentication."
  remediation: "To mitigate JWT Token Tampering vulnerabilities, enforce secure token generation and validation processes. Implement cryptographic techniques to ensure token integrity, preventing manipulation of user IDs. Thoroughly validate and authenticate tokens on the server-side to prevent unauthorized access attempts. Conduct regular security evaluations to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities, ensuring the integrity of user data and overall system security."
