info:
  name: "Exploiting BOLA by inserting API Version IDs in URL path for Unauthorized Access."
  description: > 
    "This test involves exploiting security vulnerabilities by manipulating the URL 
    path to insert API version IDs, leading to unauthorized access. This 
    technique specifically targets flaws in Object Level Authorization, allowing 
    attackers to bypass restrictions and gain access to sensitive information or 
    functionalities intended for different API versions. By exploiting BOLA 
    in this manner, unauthorized users can potentially compromise the security 
    of an application or system."

    "This test involves manipulating the URL path by inserting API Version IDs. 
    This exploitation targets Object Level Authorization vulnerabilities, allowing 
    unauthorized access to sensitive resources intended for different API versions. 
    By exploiting BOLA in this manner, attackers can compromise system security 
    and gain unauthorized entry to functionalities beyond their intended access level."
  impact: >
    "Exploiting Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA) by inserting API Version IDs 
    in the URL path can have severe impacts. Unauthorized access may lead to 
    exposure of sensitive data, manipulation of critical functionalities, and 
    potential breaches of confidentiality. This security vulnerability enables 
    attackers to compromise the integrity of the system, posing a significant 
    threat to the overall security posture and potentially causing reputational 
    damage for the affected entity."
