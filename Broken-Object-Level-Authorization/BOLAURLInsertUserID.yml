info:
  name: "Exploiting BOLA by inserting User IDs in URL path for Unauthorized Access."
  description: >
    "This test involves assessing the vulnerability of a system's authorization mechanism  by manipulating User IDs within the URL path. This form of exploitation aims to gain  unauthorized access by inserting User IDs in the URL, tricking the system into  granting privileges that should be restricted. This test helps identify weaknesses  in object-level authorization controls, ensuring that proper access restrictions  are in place and unauthorized users cannot manipulate identifiers to gain  unauthorized entry."
  details: >
    "This test involves probing for vulnerabilities in a system's authorization process.  Specifically, attackers exploit BOLA by manipulating User IDs within the URL path  to gain unauthorized access. This method targets object-level authorization controls,  aiming to bypass restrictions and exploit weaknesses in the system's security.  Identifying and addressing these vulnerabilities is crucial for preventing unauthorized  users from manipulating identifiers and accessing restricted resources."
  impact: >
    "The impact of a successful Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA) exploit can  be severe, leading to unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionalities.  Attackers could gain elevated privileges, compromising the integrity and  confidentiality of the system. This breach may result in unauthorized manipulation  or deletion of critical information, posing a significant risk to the organization's  data security. Proper mitigation strategies are essential to prevent such  unauthorized access and safeguard against potential data breaches."
