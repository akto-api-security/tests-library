  name: Race condition in like/dislike API
  description: Attacker can like/dislike a video multiple times by exploiting race condition vulnerability
  details: > 
      In a normal scenario, the user will be able to like or dislike video or comment, only after all other data was received.
      However, re-submitting the same request right after the original request, might end up in like or dislike for comment or video multiple time.
  impact: A typical TOCTOU vulnerability, allowing an attacker to steal from the DVSA by submitting out-of-order requests
