  name: "Mass Assignment Vulnerability Testing by Leveraging Integer Values Extracted from Sample or Dynamic API Data"
  description: > 
    "This test aims to fortify mass assignment vulnerability testing by utilizing integer values 
    obtained either from sample data or dynamically fetched from API endpoints. By integrating 
    integer data into vulnerability assessments, the robustness of security measures can be 
    significantly enhanced, enabling more comprehensive protection against unauthorized data 
    manipulation."
  details: >
    "This test involves injecting integer values, retrieved either from sample data or dynamically 
    through API endpoints, into mass assignment vulnerability tests. By incorporating these 
    integer data points, the effectiveness of vulnerability assessments is heightened, enabling 
    thorough scrutiny and mitigation of potential security risks associated with unauthorized 
    data manipulation."
  impact: >
    "Implementing integer values from sample or dynamic API data into mass assignment 
    vulnerability testing can greatly enhance the accuracy and reliability of security 
    assessments. This approach empowers organizations to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities 
    more effectively, reducing the risk of unauthorized data tampering and bolstering 
    overall data security. By proactively addressing potential weaknesses, businesses can 
    safeguard sensitive information and maintain trust with their stakeholders."
