  name: "Mass Assignment vulnerability test using Boolean values"
  description: > 
    "Mass Assignment vulnerability test using Boolean values involves examining whether 
    a web application's security is susceptible to unauthorized modification of sensitive 
    data through boolean parameters. This assessment typically involves manipulating boolean 
    inputs during form submissions to check if privileged fields can be altered. By 
    exploiting this vulnerability, attackers may gain unauthorized access or manipulate 
    data within the application."
  details: >
    "In this test, testers manipulate boolean parameters in form submissions to probe for 
    security weaknesses. By toggling boolean inputs, testers assess if privileged fields 
    can be modified without proper authorization. This assessment helps uncover potential 
    vulnerabilities where attackers could gain unauthorized access or tamper with sensitive 
    data within the application."
  impact: >
    "The impact of a Mass Assignment vulnerability, when exploited using Boolean values, can 
    be severe. Attackers could gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or manipulate 
    system functionality. This can lead to breaches of confidentiality, integrity, and 
    availability, potentially causing financial loss, reputational damage, and regulatory 
    penalties for affected organizations. Additionally, it can undermine user trust and 
    compromise the overall security posture of the application."
  remediation: "To mitigate mass assignment vulnerabilities using boolean values, ensure that your application implements proper input validation and sanitization. Verify that boolean values received from client requests are properly validated against a whitelist of allowed values, rather than directly applied to model attributes. Additionally, consider implementing a strong parameterization approach where only specific attributes are permitted to be updated via mass assignment. Regularly review and update your codebase to address any potential vulnerabilities, and consider implementing automated security testing to detect and prevent mass assignment issues."
