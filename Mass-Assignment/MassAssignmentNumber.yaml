  name: "Mass Assignment vulnerability test using Integer values"
  description: > 
    "Mass Assignment vulnerability test using Integer values involves examining whether 
    a web application's security is susceptible to unauthorized modification of sensitive 
    data through integer parameters. This assessment typically involves manipulating integer 
    inputs during form submissions to check if privileged fields can be altered. By 
    exploiting this vulnerability, attackers may gain unauthorized access or manipulate 
    data within the application."
  details: >
    "In this test, testers manipulate integer parameters in form submissions to probe for 
    security weaknesses. By toggling integer inputs, testers assess if privileged fields 
    can be modified without proper authorization. This assessment helps uncover potential 
    vulnerabilities where attackers could gain unauthorized access or tamper with sensitive 
    data within the application."
  impact: >
    "The impact of a Mass Assignment vulnerability, when exploited using Integer values, can 
    be severe. Attackers could gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or manipulate 
    system functionality. This can lead to breaches of confidentiality, integrity, and 
    availability, potentially causing financial loss, reputational damage, and regulatory 
    penalties for affected organizations. Additionally, it can undermine user trust and 
    compromise the overall security posture of the application."
  remediation: "To mitigate mass assignment vulnerabilities using integer values, implement strict validation and sanitization of input data in your application. Ensure that integer values are properly validated against expected ranges and do not allow users to manipulate them to gain unauthorized access. Limit mass assignment to specific attributes and enforce strong authorization controls to prevent unauthorized modifications. Regularly review and update your codebase to address any potential vulnerabilities, and conduct thorough security testing using various integer values to identify and remediate any mass assignment issues. Additionally, consider implementing automated security testing tools to proactively detect and prevent such vulnerabilities."
