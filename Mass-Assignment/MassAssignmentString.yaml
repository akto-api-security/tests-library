  name: "Mass Assignment vulnerability test using String values"
  description: >
    "Mass Assignment vulnerability test using String values involves examining whether  a web application's security is susceptible to unauthorized modification of sensitive  data through string parameters. This assessment typically involves manipulating string  inputs during form submissions to check if privileged fields can be altered. By  exploiting this vulnerability, attackers may gain unauthorized access or manipulate  data within the application."
  details: >
    "In this test, testers manipulate string parameters in form submissions to probe for  security weaknesses. By toggling string inputs, testers assess if privileged fields  can be modified without proper authorization. This assessment helps uncover potential  vulnerabilities where attackers could gain unauthorized access or tamper with sensitive  data within the application."
  impact: >
    "The impact of a Mass Assignment vulnerability, when exploited using string values, can  be severe. Attackers could gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or manipulate  system functionality. This can lead to breaches of confidentiality, integrity, and  availability, potentially causing financial loss, reputational damage, and regulatory  penalties for affected organizations. Additionally, it can undermine user trust and  compromise the overall security posture of the application."
