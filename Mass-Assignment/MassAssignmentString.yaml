  name: "Mass Assignment vulnerability test using String values"
  description: > 
    "Mass Assignment vulnerability test using String values involves examining whether 
    a web application's security is susceptible to unauthorized modification of sensitive 
    data through string parameters. This assessment typically involves manipulating string 
    inputs during form submissions to check if privileged fields can be altered. By 
    exploiting this vulnerability, attackers may gain unauthorized access or manipulate 
    data within the application."
  details: >
    "In this test, testers manipulate string parameters in form submissions to probe for 
    security weaknesses. By toggling string inputs, testers assess if privileged fields 
    can be modified without proper authorization. This assessment helps uncover potential 
    vulnerabilities where attackers could gain unauthorized access or tamper with sensitive 
    data within the application."
  impact: >
    "The impact of a Mass Assignment vulnerability, when exploited using string values, can 
    be severe. Attackers could gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or manipulate 
    system functionality. This can lead to breaches of confidentiality, integrity, and 
    availability, potentially causing financial loss, reputational damage, and regulatory 
    penalties for affected organizations. Additionally, it can undermine user trust and 
    compromise the overall security posture of the application."
