info:
  name: "Drupal Local File Inclusion"
  description: "Drupal Local File Inclusion (LFI) is a security vulnerability that occurs when a Drupal application allows user input to dictate file paths without sufficient validation or sanitization. This vulnerability can enable attackers to manipulate input and include arbitrary files from the server's filesystem, potentially exposing sensitive information such as configuration files, logs, or user data. If exploited, LFI can lead to serious security risks, including unauthorized access, information disclosure, and further attacks on the application or server. To mitigate this risk, developers should implement strict input validation and avoid allowing user-specified file paths."
  details: "Drupal Local File Inclusion (LFI) occurs when a Drupal application does not adequately validate user input for file paths, allowing attackers to include arbitrary files from the server's filesystem. By crafting specially designed requests, attackers can exploit this vulnerability to access sensitive files, such as configuration settings, user credentials, or error logs. This unauthorized access can lead to significant security breaches, including information disclosure and potential compromise of the entire application. To prevent LFI, it is crucial for developers to enforce strong input validation, implement file path whitelisting, and ensure secure coding practices throughout the application."
  impact: "The impact of Drupal Local File Inclusion (LFI) can be severe, as it allows attackers to access sensitive files on the server, leading to information disclosure and potential system compromise. By exposing critical data such as configuration files, user credentials, or application logs, attackers can leverage this information to escalate privileges, manipulate the application, or conduct further attacks. Additionally, such breaches can result in reputational damage, financial losses, and regulatory penalties for the organization. Furthermore, the exploitation of LFI vulnerabilities may provide attackers with a foothold for more advanced attacks, increasing the overall security risk to the application and its infrastructure."
