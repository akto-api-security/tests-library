  description: |
    The API response discloses exact browser and driver versions along with commit hash information.
    Example evidence includes fields such as browserVersion "139.0.7258.139" and chromedriverVersion "139.0.7258.139 (â€¦ branch-heads/7258@{#2632})".
  details: "Attackers can leverage disclosed browser and driver versions, including commit hash details, to identify version-specific CVEs or exploits. \nThis increases the risk of targeted exploitation if the exposed versions are outdated or vulnerable.\n"
  impact: "Disclosing exact software versions and commit hash details provides attackers with valuable reconnaissance information. \nIt enables version-specific exploit development and makes it easier to identify vulnerabilities in the exposed components.\n"
