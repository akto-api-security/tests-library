# Remediation for STRUTS_OLD_VERSION_OPEN_REDIRECT

## Remediation Steps for Apache Struts Old Version Open Redirect Vulnerability

The Apache Struts Old Version Open Redirect vulnerability is a severe security issue that allows attackers to redirect unauthorized web requests to any URL of their choosing. Here are the steps to mitigate this issue.

### Step 1: Update to the Latest Version of Apache Struts

The first and foremost remediation step is to update your Apache Struts framework to the latest stable version. This is to ensure that you have all the most recent security patches.

```bash
wget http://apache.mirrors.ionfish.org/struts/binaries/struts-2.x.x-all.zip
unzip struts-2.x.x-all.zip
cd struts-2.x.x-all
mv * /your/current/struts/location
```

The placeholders 2.x.x needs to be replaced with the actual version number.

### Step 2: Validate All Redirection URLs

Ensure that all redirection URLs are validated server-side, and only valid destinations are allowed.

```java
String redirectURL = request.getParameter("redirect");
if (isValidURL(redirectURL)) {
    response.sendRedirect(redirectURL);
} else {
    // handle invalid redirection URL
}
```

### Step 3: Use a Safe Method for Redirection

Instead of `response.sendRedirect()`, use `ActionRedirect`.

```java
public ActionForward execute(ActionMapping mapping, ActionForm form, HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) {
    ActionForward forward = mapping.findForward("success");

    if(isValidURL(forward.getPath())) {
        ActionRedirect redirect = new ActionRedirect(forward);
        return redirect;
    } else {
        // handle invalid redirection URL
    }
}
```
