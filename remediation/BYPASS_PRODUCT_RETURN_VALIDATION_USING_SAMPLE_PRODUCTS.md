## Remediation Steps for Bypass Product Return Validation Using Sample Products

This security vulnerability can allow attackers to bypass crucial return validation procedures for products by using sample products. Here are the steps to fix this issue.

### Step 1: Enhance Validation for Sample Products

First, you need to perform eligibility validation for sample products too. 

```python
def validate_return(product):
    if product.is_sample:
        raise ValueError("Sample products are not eligible for return")
    else:
        # Proceed with return validation for regular product
```

### Step 2: Increase Product Specificity

It's important to distinguish between sample products and regular products in your database. Avoid using a generic item status for different types of products.

```sql
UPDATE Products SET ProductType = 'Regular' WHERE ProductType IS NULL OR ProductType = 'Sample';
```

### Step 3: Develop a Separate Flow for Sample Products

Develop a separate process for handling sample products to prevent tampering with regular product returns.

```python
def handle_return(product):
    if product.is_sample:
        handle_sample_product_return(product)
    else:
        handle_regular_product_return(product)
```
