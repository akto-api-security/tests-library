# Remediation for SSRF_ON_XML_UPLOAD_AWS_REDIRECT

## Remediation Steps for Sensitive AWS Details Exposure due to SSRF

Exposure of sensitive AWS details through misconfigured Server-side Request Forgery(SSRF) attacks can allow a potential attacker to gain unauthorized access and perform unwanted actions in your AWS environment. Below are the remediation steps to prevent this vulnerability.

### Step 1: Always validate and sanitize input
Make sure  all the inputs and URL are validated, restrict the usage of certain characters that can be malicious.
```java
String safeURL = URLEncoder.encode(userInput, "UTF-8");
```

### Step 2: Use AWS Instance Metadata Service Version 2 (IMDSv2)
AWS Instance Metadata Service Version 2 (IMDSv2) adds defense in depth against open firewalls, reverse proxies, and SSRF vulnerabilities.

```bash
aws configure set metadata_options.http_tokens required
```

### Step 3: Avoid exposing AWS Security Credentials
Never embed or hard code AWS access key and secret access key directly into your code. Always use AWS SDKs or environment variables to surface these credentials.

### Step 4: Implement a Firewall or a Similar Solution 
Implement a solution that blocks unexpected outbound traffic or traffic to unrecognized domains.

### Step 5: Regularly Rotate Security Credentials 
Regularly change your security credentials to prevent any unauthorized usage.

```python
client = boto3.client('iam')

response = client.update_access_key(
    UserName='string',
    AccessKeyId='string',
    Status='Active'
)
```
