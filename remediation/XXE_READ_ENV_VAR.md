# Remediation for XXE_READ_ENV_VAR

## Remediation Steps for XML External Entity (XXE) Reading Environment Variables
An XML External Entity (XXE) attack is a serious security vulnerability that can result in disclosure of internal files, denial of service, server side request forgery, etc. Here are the steps to mitigate the issue of XXE that reads Environment Variables:

### Step 1: Disable DTDs (Document Type Definitions)
XML parsers should be configured to disallow the use of Document Type Definitions (DTDs).

Here's an example of how to do this in Java:

```java
DocumentBuilderFactory dbf = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();
String FEATURE = null;

try {
    FEATURE = "http://apache.org/xml/features/disallow-doctype-decl";
    dbf.setFeature(FEATURE, true);

    dbf.setXIncludeAware(false);
    dbf.setExpandEntityReferences(false);

    DocumentBuilder safebuilder = dbf.newDocumentBuilder();
} catch (ParserConfigurationException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

### Step 2: Disable External Entity and DTD Processing 

Here's an example in Python using the defusedxml library, which should be used to parse XML data instead of the standard XML libraries in Python as it prevents various XML attacks.

```python
from defusedxml.ElementTree import parse

tree = parse("file.xml")
```

### Step 3: Update XML Processors

Ensure your XML processor and libraries are up-to-date to prevent known vulnerabilities that can be exploited via XXE.

### Step 4: Implement Positive Server Security Controls

Input validation, strong access controls, and minimized information disclosure in error messages are other standard security controls that can help protect against XXE attacks.
