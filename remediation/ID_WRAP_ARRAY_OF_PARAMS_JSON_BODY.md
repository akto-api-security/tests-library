# Remediation for ID_WRAP_ARRAY_OF_PARAMS_JSON_BODY

## Remediation Steps for BOLA Vulnerability: Turning JSON Param into Array of Params

BOLA (Broken Object Level Authorization) vulnerabilities, such as turning a JSON parameter into an array of parameters to gain unauthorized access, can be a serious security risk. This can enable attackers to potentially access or modify data that they are not authorized to. 

### Step 1: Validate Requested Parameters
Firstly, ensure that any client provided data is properly validated before it's used.

```java
if (!Array.isArray(request.jsonParam)) {
  throw new Error("Invalid parameter");
}
```
### Step 2: Implement Authorization Checks
Next, proper authorization checks should be implemented for each object a user can access. The IDs of objects the user is authorized to access should be fetched directly from the database or API they're authorized to, rather than relying on client-provided data.

```java
// Fetch the IDs of objects the user is authorized to access
List<String> authorizedIds = getAuthorizedIds(user);

// Retrieve the requested objects
List<String> requestedIds = Arrays.asList(request.jsonParam);

// Perform an intersection to find out unauthorized accesses
List<String> unauthorizedIds = requestedIds.stream()
  .filter(id -> !authorizedIds.contains(id))
  .collect(Collectors.toList());

if (!unauthorizedIds.isEmpty()) {
  throw new Error("Unauthorized access to: " + String.join(", ", unauthorizedIds));
}
```
### Step 3: Log and Monitor Failed Attempts
Always log and monitor your systems for failed attempts and alarms, this would help you detect any potentential threat posture.

```java
if (!unauthorizedIds.isEmpty()) {
  log.error("Unauthorized access attempt by user " + user.getUsername() + " to: " + String.join(", ", unauthorizedIds));
}
```
