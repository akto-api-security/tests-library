# Remediation for EMAIL_REGEX_REDOS

## Remediation Steps for ReDOS Vulnerability in Email Parameters

ReDOS (Regular expression Denial of Service) is a type of denial of service attack where an attacker can provide a malicious input to a Regular Expression that will cause the service to consume a large amount of time or resources. Here are the steps to fix this vulnerability in an email parameter.

### Step 1: Avoid Catastrophic Backtracking in Your Regular Expressions
When validating email addresses, avoid complex regex patterns which can open the door to ReDOS attacks. Simpler patterns can be used which do not leave your application vulnerable.

```javascript
var EmailValidator = /^[a-zA-Z0-9._-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,6}$/;
```
This example regex pattern is simple and does not provide opportunity for catastrophic backtracking.

### Step 2: Use a Standard Library for Email Validation
If possible, use a built-in or third party library for email validation. These libraries have usually been tested against a variety of attack vectors and are maintained to address any vulnerabilities that are discovered.

In Python, you can use the `validators` library:

```python
import validators
if validators.email('test@example.com'):  # returns True if valid
  pass    # Handle valid email case
```

In JavaScript, consider using the `validator.js` library:

```javascript
const validator = require('validator');
if (validator.isEmail('test@example.com')) { // returns true if valid
  // Handle valid email case
}

```

### Step 3: Timeouts
As a fallback, you can implement a timeout on regex evaluation. If the process takes longer than the allotted time, it is terminated to prevent ReDOS.

```javascript
const ReDoSTimeout = new RegExp('(a+)+$');
let startTime = Date.now();
let endTime = Date.now();
try {
    '' === ReDoSTimeout.test('aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!');
    endTime = Date.now();
    if (endTime - startTime > 2000) throw new Error('Timeout');
} catch (e) {
    // Handle regex test failure or timeout
}
```

### Step 4: Regular Code Audit and Update
Regularly update your service to include the latest security patches and updates. Also perform regular code audits to catch any potential security flaws.
