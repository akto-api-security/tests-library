# Remediation for SENSITIVE_DATA_EXPOSURE_PASSWORD

## Remediation Steps for Sensitive Data Exposure: PASSWORD
Sensitive data exposure, specifically password exposure, can provide unauthorized individuals with access to secure areas or information. Passwords should always be encrypted and never stored in plain text. Additionally, ensure secure transmission of these encrypted passwords over the network.

### Step 1: Install Encryption Libraries
For most programming languages, external libraries or modules are available to assist with password encryption. Here's how to do it in Python with the bcrypt library:

```bash
pip install bcrypt
```

### Step 2: Encrypt Passwords
All passwords should be hashed and salted before being stored in the application database. Here's how to do it in Python using the bcrypt library:

```python
import bcrypt

password = b"my_password" # convert text to bytes

# Generate a salt
salt = bcrypt.gensalt()

# Generate a password hash
hashed_password = bcrypt.hashpw(password, salt)
```

### Step 3: Store Encrypted Passwords
Store the hashed password in your database. Never store plaintext passwords.
Here's an example in Python:

```python
# Assuming 'users' is your Users Model/Schema
def create_user(username, hashed_password):
    ...
    new_user = users(username=username, password=hashed_password)
    new_user.save()
    ...
```

### Step 4: Validate User Input
When checking user provided password, validate it against the hashed password in the database.

```python
# Assuming user_input_password is the password entered by the user during login
def check_password(hashed_password, user_input_password):
    ...
    return bcrypt.checkpw(
    user_input_password.encode('utf-8'),   # convert user's input from string to bytes
    hashed_password,
   )
   ...
```

### Step 5: Secure Transmission
Ensure passwords are transmitted securely across the network using secure protocols such as HTTPS.

Note: Strategies and principles may vary based on the specific language or framework you're working with, but the core idea remains the same: encrypt, never store plaintext passwords, and use secure protocols.
