# Remediation for SENSITIVE_DATA_EXPOSURE_PASSWORD

## Remediation Steps for Sensitive Data Exposure Test with Password on LLMs

Sensitive Data Exposure is a critical security issue where sensitive information such as user passwords are not adequately protected, thus providing an opportunity for attackers to gain unauthorized access.

### Step 1: Enable Password Hashing
Secure your passwords by implementing password hashing using bcrypt. Here is an example in Python:

```python
from werkzeug.security import generate_password_hash

password = "my_password"
hashed_password = generate_password_hash(password, method='pbkdf2:sha256', salt_length=8)
```

### Step 2: Secure Transmissions with HTTPS
Ensure secure transmission of sensitive data over the network by enabling HTTPS encryption. 

### Step 3: Use Secure Cookies
In your settings, configure your application to only send cookies over HTTPS.

```python
SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = True
```

### Step 4: Implement Access Controls
Implement necessary access controls to prohibit unauthorized users from accessing sensitive data. Here's an example in Python using Flask-Login:

```python
from flask_login import login_required

@app.route("/sensitive_route")
@login_required
def sensitive_func():
    pass
```

### Step 5: Regular Monitoring and Logging
Implement audit and monitoring mechanisms to keep track of access to sensitive resources. Regularly review the logs to identify any unauthorized access attempts.

 ```bash
 tail -f /var/log/your_app.log
 ```

### Step 6: Regular Updates and Patching
Keep all your system components up to date. Regularly apply security patches to ensure that known vulnerabilities are fixed promptly.
