## Remediation Steps for Apache Tomcat Open Redirect
Apache Tomcat Open Redirect Vulnerability is a web security issue where an attacker can trick users to unknowingly navigate malicious, third-party sites that could potentially be harmful. This can lead to serious consequences like sensitive information theft.

### Step 1: Update to the Latest Version
Apache has fixed the open redirect issue in their later versions. So, it's important to always run the latest stable version. For Linux users, you can update using the following commands:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install tomcat9
```

### Step 2: Use Security Filter
An appropriate security filter can be used to validate all URLs. URLs that do not match the expected structure would be rejected.

Here is a sample code for such a security filter in Java:

```java
public class SecurityFilter implements Filter {
    private static final String REDIRECT_PREFIX = "/redirect/";

    @Override
    public void doFilter(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response, FilterChain chain) 
        throws IOException, ServletException {
        HttpServletRequest httpRequest = (HttpServletRequest) request;
        String requestURI = httpRequest.getRequestURI();
        if (requestURI.startsWith(REDIRECT_PREFIX)) {
            throw new ServletException("Invalid URL");
        } else {
            chain.doFilter(request, response);
        }
    }
    // other methods
}
```

### Step 3: Regular Code Review 

Regularly reviewing your applicationâ€™s source code can help detect any potential issues before they are exploited.

### Step 4: Set HTTP Security Headers

Set HTTP security headers such as Content-Security-Policy to prevent any redirection attacks and other common exploits.

### Step 5: Regular Patching and Updates 

Always keep the Apache Tomcat server updated with the latest patches and updates released by the developers.
