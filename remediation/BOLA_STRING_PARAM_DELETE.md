# Remediation for BOLA_STRING_PARAM_DELETE

## Remediation Steps for Exploiting BOLA: Direct System Operation Using String Parameter Values with DELETE Based APIs

Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA) or Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) is a serious security issue. Without proper authorization checks, attackers can manipulate the reference to an object, gaining unauthorized access to data.

Here are steps to remediate the BOLA issue in DELETE based APIs:

### Step 1: Implement Proper Authorization

This is the most important and effective way to prevent BOLA/IDOR vulnerabilities. You need to check if the user is authorized to perform the requested operation on the object.

```python
def delete_object(user, object_id):
    object = get_object(object_id)

    if not user.has_permission("delete", object):
        raise Unauthorized("You are not allowed to delete this object")
    
    delete(object)
```

### Step 2: Use UUIDs Instead of Sequential IDs

Using UUIDs instead of sequential IDs makes it harder for an attacker to guess the IDs of objects.

```python
import uuid

def generate_id():
    return uuid.uuid4()
```

### Step 3: Implement Rate Limiting

By limiting the number of requests, you can prevent attackers from brute-forcing their way through your API.

```python
# This is a pseudo-code implementation.
def rate_limit(request):
    if request.number_of_requests > MAX_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE:
        raise RateLimitExceeded("You have exceeded the maximum number of requests per minute.")
```

### Step 4: Regular Security Audits

Lastly, conducting regular security audits is crucial to maintain a healthy and secure application. 

```bash
python manage.py check --deploy
```

These steps should provide a robust protection against BOLA/IDOR vulnerabilities. However, it's essential to keep up-to-date with the latest security best practices and continuously improve your security measures.
