# Remediation for APIGEE_NGINX_LOG_EXPOSED

## Remediation Steps for Apigee Nginx Log Exposure

Exposing Apigee Nginx logs can leak sensitive information which can be leveraged by attackers to compromise the API gateway. This could lead towards serious security issues.

### Step 1: Modify Nginx configuration to disable access logs.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
```

Locate the `access_log` directive and comment it out.

```conf
#access_log /var/log/nginx/access.log;
```

Save and exit the file.

### Step 2: Disable Error logging
Similar to Step 1, locate the `error_log` directive and comment it out.

```conf
#error_log /var/log/nginx/error.log;
```

Save and exit the file.

### Step 3: Restart Nginx 

To apply changes, you need to restart the Nginx service.

```bash
sudo service nginx restart
```

### Step 4: Secure File Permissions

Ensure that read/write permissions for the Nginx logs are only granted to trusted users.

```bash
sudo chmod 640 /var/log/nginx/*
sudo chown www-data:www-data /var/log/nginx/*
```

### Step 5: Regular Audit And Update
Periodically review your Nginx settings to ensure they remain in line with your organizational security policies.
Also, ensure to update your server regularly to receive the latest security patches and updates.

Please, note: Disabling logs should only be a temporary measure during troubleshooting. Logs are critical for detecting and analyzing incidents.
