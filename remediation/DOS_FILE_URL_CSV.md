## Remediation Steps for Denial of Service Test by Providing Large CSV File

The Denial of Service (DoS) attack by providing a large CSV file aims to overload your system by processing an excessively large file. It is one of the most common destructive attacks which disrupts the normal functioning of your system or service. To avoid this, you can perform file size validation checks and limit the amount of processing time.

### Step 1: Limit File Size
One of the first defensive measures is to check the file size before processing. Below is an example of file size validation in Python.

```python
import os

def validate_file_size(file):
    max_size = 10485760  # Set a maximum file size, e.g., 10 MB
    if os.path.getsize(file) > max_size:
        raise Exception("File size is too large.")
```

### Step 2: Limit File Processing Time

Another mitigation is to limit the amount of time your system or service spends processing a file. Through this approach, if a file takes longer to process than the defined time limit, the operation is stopped. Following is a way through multithreading in Python:

```python
import threading

def process_file(file):
    # File processing

def start_process(file):
    process_thread = threading.Thread(target=process_file, args=(file,))
    process_thread.start()
    process_thread.join(timeout=10)  # Set a timeout
    if process_thread.is_alive():
        print("Processing time exceeded.")
        process_thread.stop()  # Terminate the thread

start_process("large_file.csv")
```
Please adjust the maximum file size and processing time according to your system's capacity.
