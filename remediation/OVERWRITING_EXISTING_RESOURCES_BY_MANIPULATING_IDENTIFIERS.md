## Remediation Steps for Overwriting Existing Resources by Manipulating Identifiers
This is a common security issue where an attacker might exploit the predictable or enumerable nature of resource identifiers (IDs) and manipulate them to access or overwrite resources.

### Step 1: Implement Proper Authorization Checks
Ensure that your application checks if the current user or system has the necessary permissions to modify the resource.

```java
if(!currentUser.hasPermission(resource)) {
    throw new AuthorizationException("You do not have permission to modify this resource.");
}
```

### Step 2: Avoid Using Predictable Resource IDs
Using UUIDs or similar mechanisms can help prevent an attacker from guessing IDs of resources.

```java
import java.util.UUID;
String uniqueID = UUID.randomUUID().toString();
```

### Step 3: Implement Rate Limiting
Rate limiting can help protect against brute force attacks where an attacker might attempt to guess resource identifiers.

Here is an example in Python using the Flask-Limiter library:

```python
from flask_limiter import Limiter
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)
limiter = Limiter(app, default="100/hour")

@app.route("/api/resource/<id>")
@limiter.limit("50/minute")
def getResource(id):
    # your code here
    pass
```

### Step 4: Regular Audit and Update
Regularly audit your application code to ensure it doesn't expose any resource identifiers. Update the security packages, middleware, libraries, and frameworks that your application uses.

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
```

### Step 5: Encapsulate the resource identifiers

One could encapsulate the identifiers within an encrypted payload so that the identifiers are not visible in the request and the response itself.

Here is an example in Node.js using jsonwebtoken to encrypt and decrypt the payload:

```javascript
var jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
var SECRETKEY = 'Replace This With Your Secret Key';

//function to encrypt the payload
function encrypt(payload) {
    return jwt.sign(payload, SECRETKEY);
}

//function to decrypt the payload
function decrypt(token) {
    return jwt.verify(token, SECRETKEY);
}
```
