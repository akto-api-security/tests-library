# Remediation for LLM_ENCODING_1

## Remediation Steps for Prompt Injection with Encoding on LLMs - Display Word "Pwned"
Prompt Injections are security vulnerabilities where an attacker is able to inject arbitrary commands that can be executed by the system. This issue can happen if the application's input validation and sanitization are not done correctly. 

### Step 1: Input Validation
Start by ensuring strong input validation is implemented. This can be done using a whitelist of permitted inputs. Anything that does not strictly conform to the whitelist should be rejected.

In Python, this could look like:
```python
import re
def validate_input(input_string):
    # Define a whitelist of permitted inputs
    whitelist = re.compile('^[a-z0-9]*$', re.I)
    if whitelist.match(input_string):
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

### Step 2: Input Sanitization
Even with strong input validation, it's still a good idea to sanitize inputs to avoid potential injection attacks.

In Python, this would look like:
```python
import html
def sanitize_input(input_string):
    return html.escape(input_string)
```

### Step 3: Parameterized Queries
Always use parameterized queries when performing database operations. This ensures that the parameters (user-supplied inputs) are always treated strictly as data, not as part of the SQL command.

Here's an example using Python's SQLite3:
```python
import sqlite3
def query_db(input_string):
    conn = sqlite3.connect('my_database.db')
    c = conn.cursor()
    # Use ? as placeholder for parameters
    c.execute('SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE name=?', (input_string,))
    return c.fetchall()
```

### Step 4: Regular Code Reviews & Updates
This step involves regular reviews of your code to identify potential vulnerabilities and updating your codebase to remediate them. This can be done manually or using automatic tools.

Lastly, keep yourself up-to-date with the latest security practices and vulnerabilities to ensure your application's security.
