## Remediation Steps for Second Order SQL Injection with XSS and GET method APIs

Second-Order SQL Injections coupled with Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) are potent security issues. A successful attack can bypass traditional defenses, leading to unauthorized database access and potentially executing malicious scripts in a user's browser.

### Step 1: Parameterize Queries 
SQL Injection attacks can be prevented by parameterizing queries in your code.

For instance, in Java:

```java
String query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?";
PreparedStatement stmt = connection.prepareStatement(query);
stmt.setString(1, username);
ResultSet resultSet = stmt.executeQuery();
```

Or in Python:

```python
# Using a SQLite database
import sqlite3
conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db')
username = ("user1",)
conn.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username=?", username)
```

### Step 2: Implement Input Validation
Validating user inputs helps foil XSS attacks by ensuring characters that might be used in scripting attacks are properly encoded or rejected.

```java
public String sanitizeForXSS(String input) {
    return ESAPI.encoder().encodeForHTML(input);
}
```

Or in PHP:

```php
$clean_input = htmlspecialchars($raw_input, ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8');
```

### Step 3: Use HTTP POST Instead of GET For Sensitive Data
GET requests include data as URL parameters, which can expose information to attackers.  It's better to use POST method for transmitting sensitive data.

```javascript
fetch('/api/data', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(data),
})
```
