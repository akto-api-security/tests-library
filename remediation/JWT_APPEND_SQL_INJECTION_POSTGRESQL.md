## Remediation Steps for SQL Injection test on JWT for PostgreSQL

SQL Injection is a critical security vulnerability. An attacker can potentially run malicious SQL code against your database leading to data theft, manipulation or deletion. It is important to sanitize and validate inputs to prevent such attacks.

### Step 1: Parameterized Queries

Parameterized queries are a simple and effective way to prevent SQL injection attacks. PostgreSQL provides a way to directly process parameterized queries using the `pg` module. Here's an example using Node.js:

```javascript
const text = 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1';
const values = [1];

client.query(text, values, (err, res) => {
    if (err) {
        console.log(err.stack);
    } else {
        console.log(res.rows[0])
    }
})
```

### Step 2: Proper Input Validation

You should validate and sanitize inputs before passing them to SQL queries. For JSON Web Tokens (JWT), you should make sure the token is valid and has been issued by your server before proceeding.

A simple Node.js Example using Express and the `jsonwebtoken` library:

```javascript
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');

const authenticate = (req, res, next) => {
  const token = req.header('Authorization');

  jwt.verify(token, 'Your_SECRET_KEY', (err, user) => {
    if (err) return res.status(401).send('Access Denied.');
  
    req.user = user;
    next();
  });
};

app.use(authenticate);
```

### Step 3: Least Privilege Principle

Limit your PostgreSQL database user's permissions as much as possible without affecting the functioning of your application. This can prevent an attacker from performing disruptive actions even if they gain access to the database.
