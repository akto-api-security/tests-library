# Remediation for SENSITIVE_DATA_EXPOSURE_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID

## Remediation Steps for AWS ACCESS KEY ID Data Exposure
Exposure of AWS ACCESS KEY ID can provide unauthorized access to your AWS resources, causing major security threats. It's critical to protect these keys by not exposing them in source code or environment files and use secure methods to store and retrieve these.

### Step 1: Rotate Access Key

Find your ACCESS KEY ID that's been exposed, navigate to your Identity and Access Management (IAM) console, and generate a new Access Key ID. You should deactivate or delete the old keys.

```bash
aws iam create-access-key --user-name MY_USER_NAME
aws iam update-access-key --access-key-id OLD_ACCESS_KEY --status Inactive --user-name MY_USER_NAME
aws iam delete-access-key --access-key-id OLD_ACCESS_KEY --user-name MY_USER_NAME
```

### Step 2: Remove Exposed Key From Code

Scan your codebase for the exposed keys and remove any occurrences.

Ensure you don't include the keys in your code. AWS recommends using IAM roles and instance profiles when working with AWS services.

### Step 3: Use AWS Secrets Manager

Use AWS Secrets Manager to securely store and retrieve your AWS credentials.

```python
import boto3
from botocore.exceptions import BotoCoreError, ClientError

def get_secret():
    secret_name = "MY_SECRET_NAME"
    region_name = "REGION_NAME"

    session = boto3.session.Session()
    client = session.client(
        service_name='secretsmanager',
        region_name=region_name
    )

    try:
        get_secret_value_response = client.get_secret_value(
            SecretId=secret_name
        )
    except ClientError as e:
        raise Exception("Couldn't retrieve the secret") from e
    else:
        if 'SecretString' in get_secret_value_response:
            secret = get_secret_value_response['SecretString']
        else:
            secret = base64.b64decode(get_secret_value_response['SecretBinary'])

    return secret
```

### Step 4: Audit Security Practices
It's important to regularly audit your security practices and ensure compliance with best practices, like minimum privilege access and regular key rotation.

```bash
aws iam generate-credential-report
```
