# Remediation for WGETRC_CONFIG

## Remediation Steps for Wgetrc Configuration File Exposure

Wgetrc Configuration File Exposure allows an attacker to learn sensitive information from your `wgetrc` file, such as username and password.

### Step 1: Restrict User access to `.wgetrc` file

You can change the file permission to restrict other users from accessing the `.wgetrc` file. Run the following command:

```bash
chmod 700 ~/.wgetrc
```

This ensures only the owner can read, write, and execute the file.

### Step 2: Remove sensitive information

Remove any sensitive information (like username, password etc.) present in `.wgetrc` file. Instead, pass this information as arguments when required.

```text
// Example: Instead of writing user and password details in file
user=user_name
password=password

// Pass it as argument during the execution
wget --user=user_name --password='password' www.example.com
```

### Step 3: File Ownership

Make sure that the owner of the configuration file is the user, not root. You can change the ownership of the file like this,

```bash
chown user:user ~/.wgetrc
```

> Replace `user` with your actual username.

Please note, if removing passwords from the `.wgetrc` file is not feasible, you should at least ensure the file permissions are correctly set and file ownership is proper to minimize the security risks.

Always, audit regularly, keep your systems and applications up-to-date and ensure secure coding practices to prevent such vulnerabilities. It's a good practice to not store passwords or any other sensitive data in plain text.
