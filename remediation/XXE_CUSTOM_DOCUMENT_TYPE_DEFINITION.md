# Remediation for XXE_CUSTOM_DOCUMENT_TYPE_DEFINITION

## Remediation Steps for XML External Entity (XXE) Vulnerability with Custom Document Type Definition in API Endpoints

XXE vulnerability is a type of attack against an application that parses XML input from untrusted sources using incorrectly configured XML parser. This attack can lead to the disclosure of internal files, denial of service, server-side request forgery, port scanning, and various other exploits.

### Step 1: Disable XML External Entity Processing

In most XML processors, it is possible to disable the processing of external entities. In Java, you can configure your XML parser as follows:

```java
DocumentBuilderFactory dbf = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();
dbf.setExpandEntityReferences(false);
```

### Step 2: Disable Document Type Definitions (DTDs)

Again, in Java, DTDs can be disabled as shown below:

```java
dbf.setFeature("http://apache.org/xml/features/nonvalidating/load-external-dtd", false); // This disables external DTDs as well
dbf.setFeature("http://xml.org/sax/features/validation", false); // This disables DTDs entirely
```

### Step 3: Implement Proper Input Validation

Ensure that XML or any user inputs are properly validated and erroneous or suspicious inputs are rejected as shown below:

```java
String inputXML = "..."; // Input XML
if(inputXML.matches(".*<!DOCTYPE.*>.*")) {
    throw new Exception("Invalid XML");
}
```

### Step 4: Use Less Complex Data Formats

If possible, consider using less complex data formats such as JSON, and avoiding serialization of sensitive data.

### Step 5: Regular Audit and Update

Regularly update and patch all XML processors and libraries in use by the application to protect against any newly discovered XXE vulnerabilities.

It's worth noting that the measures above are only part of a defense-in-depth strategy against XXE attacks. Additional layers of security measures should be implemented depending on the specifics of the application and its environment.
