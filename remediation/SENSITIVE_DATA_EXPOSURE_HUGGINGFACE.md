## Remediation Steps for Sensitive Data Exposure for HUGGINGFACE
Sensitive data exposure is the unintentional exposure of sensitive data like user credentials. Below are the steps to prevent sensitive data exposure for HUGGINGFACE.
### Step 1: Eliminate Storing Sensitive Data Unnecessarily
```python
# avoid storing sensitive data in log files
log.debug("User logged in successfully!")

# do NOT do this
# log.debug("User %s logged in successfully with password %s!", username, password)
```
### Step 2: Ensure Data is Encrypted at Rest and in Transit
```bash
# For data in transit use SSL/TLS for data in motion
# Install openssl
sudo apt-get install openssl

# Generate a self-signed certificate
sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /etc/ssl/private/apache-selfsigned.key -out /etc/ssl/certs/apache-selfsigned.crt

# Configure your web server to encrypt communications using the certificate
```
For data at rest, encryption measures depend on the database used. For most SQL databases, Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) can be enabled. 

### Step 3: Use Safe API Keys
Ensure the use of API keys which are not tied to individual users. 

```python
from getpass import getpass
api_key = getpass('Enter your API key')

# do NOT do this
# api_key = "abc123"
```
### Step 4: Masking, Tokenization and Anonymization
Where possible, choose an approach to minimize the exposure of sensitive data. This can involve replacing raw values with substitutes, referred to as *tokenization*, or scrambling the data to make it unreadable, also known as *masking*. 

In the case of large datasets, *anonymization* techniques can also be applied to ensure that individual records cannot be traced back to the people they correspond to.
