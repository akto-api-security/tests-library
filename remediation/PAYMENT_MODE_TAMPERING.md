# Remediation for PAYMENT_MODE_TAMPERING

## Remediation Steps for Input Validation Using Payment Mode Field

The primary risk associated with improper input validation in the payment mode field is injection attack, which can manipulate your system. Hence, it's essential to validate the user input rigorously to prevent such attacks.

For this guide, we are going to use Python and its Flask framework for web development, and the WTForms for input validation.

### Step 1: Install Flask and WTForms

First, we need to install Flask and WTForms. Open up your terminal and type in the following command:

```bash
pip install flask WTForms  
```

### Step 2: Define a Form Class

We need to start by defining an InputForm class.

```python
from flask_wtf import FlaskForm
from wtforms import SelectField
from wtforms.validators import DataRequired

class InputForm(FlaskForm):
    payment_mode = SelectField('Payment Mode', choices=[('Credit Card', 'Credit Card'), ('Debit Card', 'Debit Card'), ('Online Banking', 'Online Banking')], validators=[DataRequired()])
```

In our InputForm, we define a select field for the payment mode and use the DataRequired validator to ensure that the field isn't submitted empty.

### Step 3: Generate and Validate Form in Route

Next, in our route handler, we generate and validate our form.

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template, request
from form import InputForm

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['SECRET_KEY'] = 'your-secret-key'

@app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def index():
    form = InputForm()
    if form.validate_on_submit():
        return 'Form Successfully Submitted!'
    return render_template('index.html', form=form)
```

Here we check if the form data is valid using form.validate_on_submit().

### Step 4: Display Form in Template

The final step is to display our form in a template.

```html
<form method="POST">
    {{ form.hidden_tag() }}
    {{ form.payment_mode.label }} {{ form.payment_mode() }}
    <input type="submit">
</form>
```

Now the user input in the payment mode field is validated before it's processed. And thus, forming a defense line against injection attacks.

### Step 5: Regular Audit and Update

Keep your software updated, as vulnerabilities may be identified and fixed in new versions. Also, perform regular audits to check for possible security issues.

```bash
pip install --upgrade flask WTForms 
```

Please replace `'your-secret-key'` with your real secret key to protect the form against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
