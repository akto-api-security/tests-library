# Remediation for MANIPULATING_ORDER_COMPOSITION_VALIDATION

## Remediation Steps for Manipulating Order Composition Validation

Manipulating order composition validation can potentially lead to unauthorized transactions. This security flaw can be fixed by improving our server-side validation method. 

Here, we will provide an example of how to fix this issue using the Python Flask and JSON Schema Validator for better data validation.

### Step 1: Install JSON Schema Validator
This involves installing `jsonschema` Python package with `pip`:

```bash
pip install jsonschema
```

### Step 2: Define Your Validation Schema
Create a JSON Schema to define the properties of your order compositions. For example:

```python
order_schema = {
    "type" : "object",
    "properties" : {
        "order_id" : {"type" : "integer"},
        "product_id" : {"type" : "integer"},
        "quantity" : {"type" : "integer"},
    },
    "required": ["order_id", "product_id", "quantity"]
}
```

### Step 3: Server-side Order Validation
Apply order composition validation on server-side whenever an order is made. Here's an example of handling a POST request with the Flask web framework.

```python
from flask import request, jsonify
from jsonschema import validate, ValidationError

@app.route('/order', methods=['POST'])
def create_order():
    try:
        data = request.get_json()
        validate(instance=data, schema=order_schema)
    except ValidationError as e:
        return jsonify({"message": str(e)}), 400

    # If validation passes, continue to process the order...
```

This way, you can ensure that only valid orders, as defined by your schema, are processed by your system.

### Step 4: Regular Auditing
It's advised to conduct regular audits on your system to ensure everything works as expected and to proactively address potential vulnerabilities.

```bash
# command to run audit
```

The actual auditing command depends on your specific setup and system. It's just a placeholder here as an important security reminder. Regular security audit should be a part of any organization's security program.
