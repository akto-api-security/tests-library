# Remediation for LLM_PKG_HALLUCINATION

## Remediation Steps for Overreliance on LLMs - Package Hallucination
Overreliance on Low-Level Modules (LLMs) - Package Hallucination is a critical security concern. This vulnerability happens when a system approves non-authentic packages, which could lead potentially to the execution of malicious code.
### Step 1: Set Up Safe Dependencies Management
The primary approach to remediate this issue is by utilizing a secure dependencies management system for your project. This type of system can verify the authenticity of the packages before they get included in your application.
```bash
# For example in Node.js environment with NPM tool:
npm install --save safe-dependencies
```
### Step 2: Access Control
Implement controls to limit packages from unverified sources. This reduces the risk associated with package hallucination.
```bash
# Example in JavaScript using .npmrc file to avoid unverified packages:
echo "registry=https://verified-registry.npmjs.org/" > .npmrc
```
### Step 3: Hash Verification 
To ensure that the received modules are authentic, implement a hash verification system to check the integrity of the installed packages.
```bash
# Example in Python using pip tool
pip install --require-hashes -r requirements.txt
```
### Step 4: Regular Audit and Update
Always keep your dependencies up to date and regularly audit them for security concerns.
```bash
# Example for npm
npm audit
```
Keep in mind that these actions alone may not fully eliminate the risk associated with overreliance on LLMs - Package Hallucination. A security-focused development methodology and thorough testing procedures are also needed.
