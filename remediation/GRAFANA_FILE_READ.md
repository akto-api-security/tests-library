# Remediation for GRAFANA_FILE_READ

## Remediation Steps for Grafana Arbitrary File Read

Grafana Arbitrary File Read is a critical security vulnerability. If not addressed, attackers can read arbitrary files from the affected server's filesystem, leading to unauthorized access to sensitive information.

### Step 1: Update Grafana
First and foremost, ensure your Grafana instance is updated to the latest version to include all the security patches and bug fixes. 

```bash
sudo yum update grafana   // centos, rhel, openSuse, Fedora
sudo apt-get update && apt-get upgrade grafana // Ubuntu or Debian
```
If using docker:
```bash
docker pull grafana/grafana:latest
docker stop <container name or id>
docker rm <container name or id>
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 grafana/grafana:latest
```

### Step 2: Limit File Permissions
Limit the permissions of the files in your server's filesystem. If there are any sensitive files, it's better to keep it out of the user running the grafana server has access.
```bash
sudo chmod 700 /path/to/your/file
```

### Step 3: Configuration Checks

Ensure all sensitive information is properly protected. This includes any information stored within the `grafana.ini` file, within environment variables, or within any of the dashboard json files.
