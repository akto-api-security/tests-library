## Remediation Steps for Nginx Virtual Host Traffic Status Module XSS Test

Nginx Virtual Host Traffic Status Module XSS flaw can allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web pages viewed by other users, leading to potential theft of sensitive information, such as login credentials.

The vulnerability can be solved by employing proper input sanitization, configuring Nginx's http headers to prevent XSS attacks and updating the software to the latest version which may have fixed these vulnerabilities.

### Step 1: Input Sanitization
Ensure that all user-supplied data is properly sanitized. Here is a snippet of Python code for input sanitization:

```python
import re

def sanitize_input(input_string):
    return re.sub(r'[<>]', '', input_string)
```

### Step 2: Configure Nginx's Http Headers
In the server block of your Nginx configuration file, set the "X-Content-Type-Options” and “Content-Security-Policy" headers in the server block using the `add_header` directive.

```bash
server {
    ... 
    add_header X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff";
    add_header Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self'";
    ...
}
```

In this case, "X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff" ensures that MIME types are not changed inappropriately, and "Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'" allows only the scripts of the same source to be executed.
