# Remediation for NGINX_VTS_XSS

## Remediation Steps for Nginx Virtual Host Traffic Status Module XSS Test

Nginx Virtual Host Traffic Status Module XSS flaw can allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web pages viewed by other users, leading to potential theft of sensitive information, such as login credentials.

The vulnerability can be solved by employing proper input sanitization, configuring Nginx's http headers to prevent XSS attacks and updating the software to the latest version which may have fixed these vulnerabilities.

### Step 1: Input Sanitization
Ensure that all user-supplied data is properly sanitized. Here is a snippet of Python code for input sanitization:

```python
import re

def sanitize_input(input_string):
    return re.sub(r'[<>]', '', input_string)
```

### Step 2: Configure Nginx's Http Headers
In the server block of your Nginx configuration file, set the "X-Content-Type-Options” and “Content-Security-Policy" headers in the server block using the `add_header` directive.

```bash
server {
    ... 
    add_header X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff";
    add_header Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self'";
    ...
}
```

In this case, "X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff" ensures that MIME types are not changed inappropriately, and "Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'" allows only the scripts of the same source to be executed.

### Step 3: Update the Software
Make sure to use the latest version of your software, as they often contain fixes for these kinds of vulnerabilities.

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade nginx
```

### Step 4: Regular Audit and Updates

Regularly audit the logs and keep your server updated to catch any potential vulnerabilities in the future. 

```bash
sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/access.log
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade nginx
```

Remember to restart your Nginx server after each configuration change:

```bash
sudo service nginx restart
```

These steps help mitigate the risk of XSS attack through the Nginx Virtual Host Traffic Status Module.
