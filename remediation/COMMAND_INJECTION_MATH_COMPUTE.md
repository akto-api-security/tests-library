## Remediation Steps for Command Injection via Arithmetic Expression Execution with Echo

Command injection is a critical security risk where an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on a system by exploiting its vulnerabilities. In this case, the issue lies with arithmetic expression execution via the `echo` command.

### Step 1: Validate and Sanitize User Input

To prevent command injection, you should always validate and sanitize user input, especially when it's used in system commands. 

For example, in Python you could use a regex pattern to accept only numeric input:

```python
import re

def sanitize(input):
    if re.match("^[0-9]+$", input):
        return input
    else:
        raise ValueError('Invalid input')
```

### Step 2: Use Safe API

If possible, use language APIs that can execute commands in a safe manner. In Python, the `subprocess` module provides a method `run` which is inherently safer than using `os.system`.

```python
import subprocess

subprocess.run(['echo', sanitized_input])
```

### Step 3: Use Parameterized Functions

Avoid using methods which can run shell commands. If these methods are inevitable, use parameterized functions.

In PHP, use `exec()` instead of `system()` or `shell_exec()`, and provide argument separately from the command:

```php
$sanitized_input = sanitize($input);
exec('echo ' . escapeshellarg($sanitized_input));
```
