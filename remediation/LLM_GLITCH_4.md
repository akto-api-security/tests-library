## Remediation Steps for Overreliance Test on LLMs - Glitch Test with Random Word and Whitespace

Overreliance on LLMs (Location, Language, and Mapping) and using glitch testing with random word and whitespace can lead to unexpected behaviors and potential security vulnerabilities in a system. 

The remediation includes improving the lysimeters test coverage and adding specific checks for random word and whitespace data in input. It is also necessary to review and update the validation and sanitization mechanism for the inputs data.

### Step 1: Improve Test Coverage

Testing should include not only expected but also unexpected inputs. 

```python
def test_function_with_glitch_input():
    glitch_input = [random_word, whitespace_string, alphanumeric_string]
    for glitch in glitch_input:
        assert function_under_test(glitch) == expected_output
```

### Step 2: Add a String Sanitization Function

A function that can sanitize and validate input strings should be used. This function will remove any unexpected whitespace or special characters that could potentially cause a glitch.

```python
def sanitize_input(input_string):
    sanitized_input = input_string.strip()
    return sanitized_input
```

### Step 3: Validate Input 

Use sanitized input in your function and validate it carefully. 

```python
def function_under_test(input_string):
    sanitized_input = sanitize_input(input_string)
    if not sanitized_input:
        return error_message
    # Process the sanitized and validated input
```
