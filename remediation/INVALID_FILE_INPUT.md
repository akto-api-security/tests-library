## Remediation Steps for Invalid File Input Leaking Sensitive Details Via Verbose Error Message

When sensitive details are leaked via verbose error messages due to invalid file input, it could lead to potential security vulnerabilities. Attackers may exploit this information to gain unauthorized access to critical resources and information. Here are some remediation steps to handle such issues.

### Step 1: Handling Errors Properly

In your error handling code, avoid exposing sensitive information. Keep the error message generic for the end user and log the specific details in a secure log for further analysis.

```python
try:
    # Code that may raise an error
except Exception as e:
    # Log the actual error message in a secure log for further analysis
    print("An error occurred while processing your request. Please try again later.")
```

### Step 2: Enable Secure File Input Validation

Ensure that the input file is validateding prior to any processing. This could be done checking file type, size and content.

```python
import os
def secure_file_input(file):
    if file:
        # Check file type
        if file.content_type not in ALLOWED_MIME_TYPES:
            raise ValueError("File type not allowed.")
        
        # Check file size
        if file.size > MAX_FILE_SIZE:
            raise ValueError("File size exceeds allowed limit.")
        
        return True
    
    return False
```

### Step 3: Disable Detailed Server Error Auto Reporting 

This depends on your server settings. For instance, in a Flask application, you can set the following to disable the behavior.

```python
app.config['DEBUG'] = False
```
