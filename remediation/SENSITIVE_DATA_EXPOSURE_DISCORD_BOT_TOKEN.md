## Remediation Steps for Sensitive Data Exposure of DISCORD BOT TOKEN

Exposing sensitive data such as Discord bot tokens can lead to serious security issues. Unauthorized access to the bot can allow potential malicious users to perform activities within the guild/server it is a part of. Follow the steps below to address this issue.

### Step 1: Regenerate your Discord Bot Token

Go to Discord developer portal and regenerate your bot token. Here is a Python pseudocode to illustrate this:

```python
import requests

# replace these values with your actual client_id and client_secret
client_id = 'your_client_id'
client_secret = 'your_client_secret'

def regenerate_token(client_id, client_secret):
    data = {
        'client_id': client_id,
        'client_secret': client_secret
    }
    response = requests.post('https://discordapp.com/api/v6/applications/{client_id}/reset-bot-token', data=data)
    print(response.json()['token'])

regenerate_token(client_id, client_secret)
```

### Step 2: Store your Token Securely

Your Discord Bot Token should be considered as sensitive as a password. Never push it to public repositories and keep it out of program source code where possible. Instead, use environment variables or separate configuration files excluded from version control. Check out this example in Python:

```python
import os

# Load the token from environment variable
TOKEN = os.getenv('DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN')
```

To set an environment variable, check the instructions based on your Operating System. Here is a Linux pseudocode:

```bash
export DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_token
```

### Step 3: Apply Correct Permissions to the Usage of Bot

Limit the permissions of the bot to decrease the impacts in case of token leakage.
