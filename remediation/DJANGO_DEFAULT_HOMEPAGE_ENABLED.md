# Remediation for DJANGO_DEFAULT_HOMEPAGE_ENABLED

## Remediation Steps for Django Default Homepage Enabled
Default Django homepage can reveal significant details about your server configuration to attackers. It is generally advisable to disable it before deploying your application to production.
### Step 1: Set Debug to False
Django debug mode is one of the major factors that enable Django's default homepage. To disable it, set the DEBUG variable in the settings.py file to False.

```Python
# settings.py
DEBUG = False
```

### Step 2: Configure Suitable Homepage
Define a view to be displayed as the homepage in your Django application and point the root URL configuration to this view.

```Python
# views.py
from django.http import HttpResponse
def home(request):
    return HttpResponse("Welcome to my website!")

# urls.py
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.home, name='home'),
]
```

### Step 3: Error Page Handling
When DEBUG is set to False, Django will not handle 404 errors for you. Define a custom 404 error view and link it in your root url configurations.

```Python
# views.py
from django.http import HttpResponseNotFound

def error_404(request, exception):
    return HttpResponseNotFound('Sorry, nothing at this address.')

# urls.py
from django.urls import path
from . import views

handler404 = 'my_app.views.error_404'
```

### Step 4: Update ALLOWED_HOSTS 
Allow connections only from trusted hosts. Modify the ALLOWED_HOSTS variable in settings.py according to your needs.

```Python
# settings.py
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['your_domain.com', 'localhost', '127.0.0.1']
```

### Step 5: Restart Server
Finally, restart your Django server for these changes to take effect.

```bash
python3 manage.py runserver
```

Remember to revisit these settings whenever you update your app or Django itself.
