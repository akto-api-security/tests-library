## Remediation Steps for CORS Whitelist Origin Validation

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a mechanism that allows many resources (e.g., fonts, JavaScript, etc.) on a web page to be requested from another domain outside the domain from which the resource originated. It's a useful security feature, but it must be configured correctly to ensure that certain resources are not being shared with malicious actors.

### Step 1: Configure CORS Headers Appropriately
You need to configure CORS headers properly in your server configuration. For example, in Node.js Express, you'd do:

```javascript
var express = require('express');
var cors = require('cors');
var app = express();

var corsOptions = {
    origin: function (origin, callback) {
        if (whitelist.indexOf(origin) !== -1) {
            callback(null, true)
        } else {
            callback(new Error('Not allowed by CORS'))
        }
    }
}

app.use(cors(corsOptions));
```

Replace `whitelist` with the list of your trusted domains.

### Step 2: Validate Origins

CORS headers can be configured to echo the request's `Origin` as the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`. This is based on a white-list of allowed origins.

```javascript
var whitelist = ['http://example1.com', 'http://example2.com']
var corsOptions = {
    origin: function (origin, callback) {
        if (whitelist.indexOf(origin) !== -1 || !origin) {
            callback(null, true)
        } else {
            callback(new Error('Not allowed by CORS'))
        }
    }
}
```
### Step 3: Avoid Reflective Origin Validation

You should avoid reflective origin validation. If the server needs to support multiple origins, it should keep a whitelist of trusted origins and check each incoming Origin against the list.
