## Remediation Steps for Manipulating Client-Side Timestamps
Manipulating Client-side timestamps is a security issue that can result in impaired application performance or unauthorized behaviours. This manipulation mainly happens when an application trusts timestamps sent by the client without proper validation. Here is a way to secure your system against such vulnerabilities.

### Step 1: Server-Side Timestamp Generation
Instead of relying on client-side timestamps, ensure that important timestamps are generated on the server-side. This prevents a client from tampering with the timestamp.

```javascript
let serverTime = new Date();
```
In this JavaScript example, the serverTime captures the current date and time from the server.

### Step 2: Validate Client-Side Timestamps
If you must use client-side timestamps, validate them on the server to ensure they are within an acceptable range. This involves comparing the client timestamp to the server's timestamp.

```javascript
let clientTime = new Date(clientTimestamp);
let serverTime = new Date();

if (Math.abs(serverTime - clientTime) > acceptableRange) {
    // Reject the timestamp
}
```
In this JavaScript example, the client timestamp is rejected if the absolute difference from the server time is greater than a predefined acceptable range.

### Step 3: Protect Timestamp Data during Transmission
Finally, always secure timestamp data during transmission. SSL/TLS protocols can be used to securely transit these timestamps.
