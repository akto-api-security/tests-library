## Remediation Steps for Rails File Content Disclosure
Rails File Content Disclosure is a serious security issue. If the issue is exploited, it may allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information that may be contained in files within your Rails application's file system. 

### Step 1: Update your Version of Rails
Outdated versions of Rails are often more vulnerable to Security threats. Make sure to update Rails to take benefit of the latest security fixes.
```bash
gem update rails
```
### Step 2: Restrict File Access 
Limit the access and read permissions of potentially sensitive files.
```bash
chmod 700 path_to_your_sensitive_file
```
### Step 3: Input Validation
Ensure that you validate all inputs that may lead to files. This could be achieved by white-listing the acceptable inputs.
Using Ruby, this can be achieved as below:
```ruby
def validate_input(input)
  white_list = ["acceptable", "inputs"]
  raise "Invalid Input" unless white_list.include?(input)
end
```

### Step 4: Use Rails' Send File Method
If you're allowing users to download files, use Rails' send_file method, which separates file data from the file's actual path on your system.
```ruby
def download
  path = "/path/to/file"
  send_file path, filename: "your_file_name"
end
```
