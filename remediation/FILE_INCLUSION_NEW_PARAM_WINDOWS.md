Local File Inclusion (LFI) is a serious security vulnerability that allows attackers to include files on a server through the web browser.

### Step 1: Input Sanitization
The first step to remediation is sanitizing user input. It is important to never trust input from user completely. Here's how you could sanitize input in PHP for example:
```php
$allowed_files = ['allowed_file1', 'allowed_file2', 'allowed_file3'];
$file = $_GET['filename'];

if (in_array($file, $allowed_files)) {
    include($file);
}
```
In the example above, only predetermined filenames are included.

### Step 2: Disable Display of Errors
Disabling the display of errors in a production environment is good practice as this limits the amount of information an attacker can gather about the system. Here is the code sample:
```php
ini_set('display_errors', '0');
```

### Step 3: Patch Your System Regularly
It is important to regularly update and patch your system and software to avoid any known vulnerabilities. This is not code-specific but is a critical step in maintaining the security of your system.

### Step 4: Use absolute file paths
Avoid using user supplied data in the file include statements. Always sanitize any user input and employ as many server-side validation checks as possible.
```php
$path = '/home/site/includes/';
include($path . 'file.php');
```
In the example above, we're using an absolute path, therefore limiting the file include function to a specific directory.

### Step 5: Limit File Permissions
Limit permissions on the file system for web-facing applications as much as possible, to reduce impact if a security vulnerability in the application is exploited.
