# Remediation for PAYMENT_GATEWAY_SQL_INJECTION_SQLITE

## Remediation Steps for SQL Injection on Payment Gateway API for SQLite

SQL Injection is a critical security vulnerability that could allow an attacker to manipulate SQL queries, leading to unauthorized access, data theft or alteration, and potentially system compromise.

### Step 1: Use Parameterized Queries
Parameterized queries are a strong way to prevent SQL injection. IoT ensures that inputs are treated as literal values and not part of the SQL command.

In Python, you can use the SQLite3 library's support for parameterized queries.

```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to SQLite database
conn = sqlite3.connect('database.db')

# Create cursor
c = conn.cursor()

# Example of a parameterized query
c.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username=? AND password=?", (username, password,))
```

### Step 2: Data Validation
Validate user-provided data before using it in SQL queries. Reject inputs that contain SQL keywords or special characters

```python
# pseudo code
if username.contains('AND' | 'OR' | '--' | ';' | '/*' | '*/' | '@@' | '@' |'char' || etc) {
    return "Invalid input";
}
```

### Step 3: Least Privilege Principle
Ensure the database user used by the application has the least privileges necessary. This can limit the impact of successful SQL injection attacks.

### Step 4: Regularly Update and Patch
Keep your SQLite and API software up-to-date to ensure you have the latest security patches.

```bash
# Example for updating sqlite3 in Ubuntu
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade sqlite3
``` 

### Step 5: Error Handling
Avoid revealing database errors to end-users, as this can give attackers hints about the SQL syntax and structure. Handle errors internally, and only provide necessary information to the user. 

```python
# pseudocode
try {
    # SQL operations here
}
catch (exception) {
    return "An error occurred.";
}
``` 

### Step 6: Use Web Application Firewalls
A WAF can help filter out malicious data, reducing the risk of SQL Injection.

```bash
# Example installing ModSecurity for Apache
sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-security2
sudo mv /etc/modsecurity/modsecurity.conf-recommended /etc/modsecurity/modsecurity.conf
# Edit the configuration file to set SecRuleEngine On
sudo vim /etc/modsecurity/modsecurity.conf
```

Remember, no solution provides 100% security, and these steps should part of a multilayered security strategy.
