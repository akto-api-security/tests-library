# Remediation for APACHE_AXIS2_DEFAULT_LOGIN

## Remediation Steps for Apache Axis2 Default Login

Apache Axis2 default login is a security vulnerability often encountered when the default credentials for the Apache Axis2 interface are left unchanged. This leaves the system exposed to potential unauthorized access and misuse.

### Step 1: Change Default Credentials
The default login is typically "admin" and "axis2". It is recommended to immediately change these upon installation. This can be done by navigating to the Axis2 web interface, selecting the 'Administration' link and changing the password in the 'Change Password' section.

### Step 2: Update Configuration File

You can also directly modify the configuration file to change the credentials. Find the `axis2.xml` configuration file and locate the `<parameter name="userName">` and `<parameter name="password">` elements.

Here is an example using Bash to replace "admin" and "axis2" with "safeUser" and "safePass".

```bash
sed -i 's/<parameter name="userName">admin<\/parameter>/<parameter name="userName">safeUser<\/parameter>/g' /path/to/your/axis2.xml
sed -i 's/<parameter name="password">axis2<\/parameter>/<parameter name="password">safePass<\/parameter>/g' /path/to/your/axis2.xml
```

Please replace `/path/to/your/axis2.xml` with the actual directory path to your `axis2.xml` file, and replace "safeUser" and "safePass" with your new chosen credentials.

### Step 3: Regularly Updating and Auditing

Regularly update Apache Axis2 to the latest version to maximize your protection against vulnerabilities. Regularly audit your system for unusual activities or signs of unauthorized access.

```bash
service apache2 restart
```

Remember to restart Apache service for the changes to take effect.
