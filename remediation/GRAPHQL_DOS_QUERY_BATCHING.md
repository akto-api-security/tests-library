## Remediation Steps for Denial of Service Test on GraphQL API with High Amount of Queries / Query Batching in Single Request
Denial of Service (DoS) in GraphQL can occur when an attacker sends more queries/complex queries than the application can handle. Here are some steps to remediate this issue:

### Step 1: Implement Rate Limiting
One way to protect against DoS attacks is to limit the number of requests/queries a client can make within a given time. 

```javascript
const rateLimit  = require('express-rate-limit');

app.use(rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 100, // limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
}));
```

### Step 2: Query Complexity Analysis
To avoid complex queries that could cause a DoS issue, you could analyze the complexity of incoming queries and reject the ones that are too complicated. The [graphql-validation-complexity](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@socialgouv/graphql-validation-complexity) can be useful for this.

```javascript
import queryComplexity, { simpleEstimator } from 'graphql-query-complexity';

const server = new ApolloServer({
  schema,
  validationRules: [
    queryComplexity({
      // The maximum allowed query complexity, queries above this threshold will be rejected
      maximumComplexity: 1000,
      // The query variables. This is needed because the variables are not available 
      // in the visitor of the graphql-js library
      variables: {},
      onComplete: (complexity: number) => {
        console.log("Query Complexity:", complexity);
      },
      // This will assign each field a complexity of 1 if no other estimator returned a value.
      estimators: [
        simpleEstimator({ defaultComplexity: 1 })
      ]
    })
  ]
});
```

### Step 3: Limit Query Depth
To prevent nested queries which could result in huge payloads and overuse of resources, we can limit the depth of the queries.

```javascript
import depthLimit from 'graphql-depth-limit'

const server = new ApolloServer({
  schema,
  validationRules: [depthLimit(10)]
});
```
