# Remediation for INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS_CHECK

## Remediation Steps for Exploiting Transactions APIs by Passing Values Over Sufficient Funds
Exploiting Transactions APIs by Passing Values Over Sufficient Funds is a severe security issue. When not properly validated, attackers may perform transactions with insufficient balance, causing financial loss and data integrity issues.

### Step 1: Check Amount Before Transaction
In your Transaction API's implementation, you should always check whether the user has sufficient balance before performing any transactions.
```Python
def transaction(sender, receiver, amount):
    if sender.balance >= amount:
        sender.balance -= amount
        receiver.balance += amount
    else:
        raise ValueError("Insufficient balance in sender's account")
```

### Step 2: Use Database Transactions
Database transactions ensure that all related changes are conducted within an atomic unit. It either works completely or not at all. This approach provides a powerful way to maintain integrity and consistency.

```Python
def transaction(sender, receiver, amount):
    with database.transaction() as txn:
        if sender.balance >= amount:
            sender.balance -= amount
            receiver.balance += amount
            sender.save()
            receiver.save()
        else:
            txn.rollback()
            raise ValueError("Insufficient balance in sender's account")
```
### Step 3: Implement Appropriate Error Handling
Throwing proper exceptions allows your application to handle anomalous situations gracefully. 

```Python
def transaction(sender, receiver, amount):
    with database.transaction() as txn:
        try:
            if sender.balance >= amount:
                sender.balance -= amount
                receiver.balance += amount
                sender.save()
                receiver.save()
            else:
                raise ValueError("Insufficient balance in sender's account")
        except Exception as e:
            txn.rollback()
            print(f"Transaction failed due to {str(e)}")
```
### Step 4: Regular Audit and Update
Regularly auditing your codebase for possible vulnerabilities and keeping your application up-to-date with the latest security patches can help prevent exploitation of this nature.

```Python
# Regular Audit
manage.py check --deploy

# Update
pip install --upgrade Django
```
