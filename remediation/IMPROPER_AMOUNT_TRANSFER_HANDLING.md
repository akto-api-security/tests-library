## Remediation Steps for Improper Amount Transfer Handling
Improper amount transfer handling is a severe security issue. If left unaddressed, it could lead to potential unauthorized transactions and amounts. 

To fix this vulnerability, check all transactions carefully, validate transfer amounts before and after transactions, and maintain a proper log for future audit purposes. Below is an example in Java demonstrating how to address this problem.

### Step 1: Validate Transaction Value and Authority 

Always validate the transaction value first, and ensure the transaction is made by an authorized user.

```java
public class Transaction {
    private static final double MAX_TRANSACTION_AMOUNT = 10000.0;

    public void handleTransfer(User user, double amount) throws SecurityException, IllegalArgumentException {
        if(user == null || !user.hasAuthority("TRANSFER_FUNDS")) {
            throw new SecurityException("Unauthorized User");
        }
        if(amount <= 0 || amount > MAX_TRANSACTION_AMOUNT) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid Amount");
        }
        //continue with the transaction
    }
}
```

### Step 2: Confirm Changes After Transaction

Validating the transaction result will ensure that the transfer has been made correctly.

```java
public class Transaction {
    void handleTransfer(User user, Account fromAccount, Account toAccount, double amount) {
        // Validate transaction and user's authority
        // ...
        double initialFromAccountBalance = fromAccount.getBalance();
        double initialToAccountBalance = toAccount.getBalance();
        // Perform transaction 
        // ...
        if(fromAccount.getBalance() != (initialFromAccountBalance - amount)) {
            throw new SecurityException("Error in transaction");
        }
        if(toAccount.getBalance() != (initialToAccountBalance + amount)) {
            throw new SecurityException("Error in transaction");
        }
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Logging the Transactions

Effective audit logging can help to analyze any discrepancies or issues related to transactions in the future.

```java
public class Transaction {
    private Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(Transaction.class);

    void handleTransfer(User user, Account fromAccount, Account toAccount, double amount) {
        // multiple validations here
        // transaction handling
        // ...

        logger.info("Transferred {}, from account {}, to account {}, performed by user {}", amount, fromAccount.getId(), toAccount.getId(), user.getName());
    }
}
```

Ensure proper exception handling, audit trails, and user validation processes are in place to prevent issues arising from improper amount transfer handling.
