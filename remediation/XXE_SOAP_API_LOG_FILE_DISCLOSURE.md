# Remediation for XXE_SOAP_API_LOG_FILE_DISCLOSURE

## Remediation Steps for XML External Entity (XXE) on SOAP API

An XML External Entity attack is a type of attack against an application that parses XML input. Attackers can exploit vulnerable XML processors if they can upload XML or include hostile content in an XML document, exploiting vulnerable code, dependencies, or integrations.

### Step 1: Disable DTD (Document Type Definition) in XML parsers

In most XML parsers, like Java's default XML parser, there's an option to disable DTD. Here's an example in Java.

```java
DocumentBuilderFactory dbf = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();
dbf.setFeature("http://apache.org/xml/features/disallow-doctype-decl", true);
``` 

By setting the `disallow-doctype-decl` feature to `true`, DTD is disabled and hence prevents XML bombs or any attempts to access external entities.
  
### Step 2: Safe XML Parsers

Use Safe XML parsers that are not vulnerable to XXE, or configure your XML parsers to prevent XXE if possible. Here's an example in Python how to do that using `defusedxml` which is a more secure alternative to Python's xml modules.

```python
from defusedxml.lxml import parse

# Parse an XML document without DTD
xml = parse("path/to/xml/file")

# xml is now secure against XXE attacks
```

### Step 3: Use of Firewalls

To further reduce the attack surface, ensure that proper firewall rules are in place to disallow any incoming connections on unnecessary ports. 

### Step 4: Regular Audit and Update

Regularly check for updates for your XML parsers or libraries which may include security patches against XXE attacks and apply them as soon as possible. It's also recommended to have your code go through a dependency check to ensure that no vulnerable components are being used.

```bash
# Depending on the package manager being used

# For npm (Node.js)
npm audit fix

# For pip (Python)
pip-review --local --interactive
```

**Note:** Ensure that your XML data doesn't need to be declared with a DTD before disabling DTDs all together. This might break XML parsing for your application. Confirm before implementing.
