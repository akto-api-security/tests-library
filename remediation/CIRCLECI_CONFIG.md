# Remediation for CIRCLECI_CONFIG

## Remediation Steps for CircleCI config.yml Exposure

CircleCI config.yml exposure is a serious security issue. If this file is improperly secured, attackers may gain unauthorized access to your CI/CD pipeline. This would effectively compromise your application's deployment and potentiallyexpose sensitive application environment variables  

### Step 1: Secure your config.yml File

```bash
# Change file permissions to read and write for the file owner only
chmod 600 .circleci/config.yml
```

### Step 2: Check .gitignore File

Ensure that .circleci/config.yml is not tracked by git. If necessary, add this line to your .gitignore file:

```bash
echo ".circleci/config.yml" >> .gitignore
```

### Step 3: Remove config.yml File from the Repository History

If the file was previously committed to the repository, you need to remove it from the history. Use git filter-branch or the BFG Repo-cleaner tool to clean your repository.

```bash
git filter-branch --force --index-filter \
  "git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch .circleci/config.yml" \
  --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all

# Push changes to the repository
git push origin --force --all
```

### Step 4: Cycle Your Secrets

Any secrets or sensitive information in the config.yml file should be considered compromised if it has been exposed. You should update these secrets as soon as possible within your CircleCI environment settings.
