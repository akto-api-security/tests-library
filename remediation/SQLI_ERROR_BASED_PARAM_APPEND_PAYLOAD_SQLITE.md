## Remediation Steps for Error Based SQL Injection Test for Parameters by Appending Payloads for SQLite

Error Based SQL Injection is a serious security vulnerability that allows attackers to exploit your database. By appending payloads for SQLite, an attacker can interfere with the intended operation of your application. This can lead to unauthorized data exposure, data manipulation, and potentially even full system compromise.

### Step 1: Use Parameterized Queries

Parameterized queries ensure that parameters are treated strictly as data and not executable code. By using this approach, we can reduce the likelihood of SQL Injection.

**Python Example:**

```python
import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect('database.db')
c = conn.cursor()

# Never do this -- insecure!
# symbol = 'RHAT'
# c.execute("SELECT * FROM stocks WHERE symbol = '%s'" % symbol)

# Do this instead
t = ('RHAT',)
c.execute('SELECT * FROM stocks WHERE symbol=?', t)
print(c.fetchone())
```

### Step 2: Use an ORM Tool

ORM (Object Relational Mapping) tools can assist to prevent SQL injection by abstracting the SQL queries and making sure any data used in queries is properly escaped. Utilize an ORM tool that's provided or compatible with your programming language.

### Step 3: Limit Database Privileges

Another important security step is to limit the privileges of the database account used by your application. For instance, if your application only needs to perform SELECT operations, don't give it privileges to perform DELETE or DROP operations.
