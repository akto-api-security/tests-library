## Remediation Steps for Denial of Service attacks via Long and Random strings in Query Param Keys
Denial of Service (DoS) attacks can make your application unresponsive by overloading it with long and random strings in Query Param Keys. To prevent these attacks, you need to enforce restrictions on the input by implementing input validation, rate limiting, and size limiting.

### Step 1: Implement Input Validation
You can use an allowlist approach that denies all inputs that do not explicitly match the expected values. For example, in Python with Flask, you can use 'WTForms' for input validation:

```python
from flask_wtf import FlaskForm
from wtforms import StringField, SubmitField
from wtforms.validators import DataRequired, Length

class MyForm(FlaskForm):
    name = StringField('Name', [DataRequired(), Length(min=1, max=100)])
    submit = SubmitField('Submit')
```
This checks if the input is an alphanumeric string between 1 and 100 characters.

### Step 2: Implement Rate Limiting
Rate limiting limits the number of requests a client can make in a certain amount of time. This example uses Flask Limiter to restrict a client to 10 requests per minute:

```python
from flask import Flask
from flask_limiter import Limiter

app = Flask(__name__)
limiter = Limiter(app, key_func=get_remote_address, default_limits=["200 per day", "50 per hour"])

@app.route("/my_endpoint")
@limiter.limit("10/minute")  # 10 requests per minute
def my_endpoint():
    return "Hello, World!"
```

### Step 3: Implement Size Limiting
To prevent sending of large strings, you can enforce size limits on Query Param. This can be done through the underlying web server or through the application itself.

For example, in Nginx, you can limit query string length with the `large_client_header_buffers` directive:

```nginx
http {
    ...
    large_client_header_buffers 4 8k;
    ...
}
```
In this example, Nginx permits up to four 8KB buffers for the request line and headers, which should be adequate for most situations.
