## Remediation Steps for Parameters.yml - File Discovery

The Parameters.yml file is often used in Symfony to store sensitive parameters such as database passwords and secret keys. If this file is discovered by a malicious actor, it could lead to a significant breach of security. 

### Step 1: Restrict Access to Parameters.yml

First, you should limit access to the Parameters.yml file. This can be accomplished by modifying the file permissions so that it is only readable by the necessary parties.

```bash
sudo chmod 700 /path/to/parameters.yml
```

### Step 2: Enable .gitignore 

If your project is stored in a Git repository, make sure that Parameters.yml is added to your .gitignore file to prevent this sensitive file from being included in the repository.

```bash
echo "parameters.yml" >> .gitignore
```

### Step 3: Implement Symfony Secrets

Symfony 4.4 introduced a new feature for managing sensitive information: Secrets. This way, secrets are no longer stored in the parameters.yml file. If you are using Symfony 4.4 or later, implement this feature to further improve the security of your application.

```bash
# In your .env.local file
APP_SECRET='%env(resolve:APP_SECRET)%'

# Add the secret to Symfony's Secret Vault
symfony console secrets:set APP_SECRET
```
