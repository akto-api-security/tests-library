# Remediation for BYPASS_CAPTCHA_REMOVING_COOKIE

## Remediation Steps for Bypass CAPTCHA Protection by Removing Cookie

Bypassing CAPTCHA mechanisms by removing a cookie can lead to various security threats such as spam, brute force attacks, or even data theft. It's crucial to fix the vulnerability at the earliest to prevent potential exploits.

### Step 1: Validate Cookies
In most scripting languages, a function can be called to verify whether a cookie exists and is related to the current session. Expired or invalid cookies should be discarded immediately. 

For example, in PHP,

```php
<?php 
    if(!isset($_COOKIE[$cookies_name])) {
        // There is no valid cookie. Show CAPTCHA
    } else {
        // Cookie is valid, continue with the flow
    }
?>
```

### Step 2: Implement Server-side Validation

This step involves checking the CAPTCHA result submitted by user with the CAPTCHA result stored in the server-side session rather than cookies. Reinforce server-side validation as client-side validation can be easily bypassed by an attacker.

Example in Python,

```python
from flask import session, request

def validate_captcha():
    user_captcha = request.form['captcha']
    session_captcha = session['captcha']

    if user_captcha != session_captcha:
        return False    # Return error here, CAPTCHA validation failed
    return True
```

### Step 3: Use Secure and HttpOnly Cookies

To prevent malicious JavaScript code from accessing cookies, set cookies with the Secure and HttpOnly flags.

Example in Node.js,

```javascript
res.cookie('cookieName', 'data', {
    secure: true,   // set cookie secure flag
    httpOnly: true, // set cookie httponly flag
});
```

### Step 4: Implement CAPTCHA Refresh

Provide an option to refresh CAPTCHA for user. Once refreshed, invalidate the old CAPTCHA stored in server-side session and replace with the newly generated CAPTCHA.

```python
from flask import session
from some_captcha_generator import generate_captcha

def refresh_captcha():
    new_captcha = generate_captcha()
    session['captcha'] = new_captcha
    # return or render the new captcha
```
