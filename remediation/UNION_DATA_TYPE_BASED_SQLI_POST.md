# Remediation for UNION_DATA_TYPE_BASED_SQLI_POST

## Remediation Steps for Union based SQL Injection test with data type variations on POST method APIs

Union-based SQL injection is a critical security vulnerability that can let attackers exploit your databases by manipulating SQL queries used within your code.

### Step 1: Use Prepared Statements
The most effective way to prevent SQL Injection is to use prepared statements. Here is an example in Java using JDBC:

```java
// assuming a java.sql.Connection object, named 'conn'

PreparedStatement ps = conn.prepareStatement("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?");
ps.setString(1, username);
ResultSet rs = ps.executeQuery();
```

In this example, 'username' is a variable that holds user-supplied input. Even if it contains malicious SQL, the database will interpret it only as a string literal and not executable code.

### Step 2: Use an ORM (Object Relational Mapping) Tool
ORM tools like Hibernate in Java or SQLAlchemy in Python can also help prevent SQL injections as they use parameterized queries and escape SQL properly.

Here is an example using SQLAlchemy in Python:

```python
# assuming 'session' is a SQLAlchemy session, and 'User' is a mapped class

users = session.query(User).filter(User.name == username).all()
```

In this case, SQLAlchemy automatically creates parameterized SQL queries and escapes special characters to prevent dangerous SQL execution.

### Step 3: Limiting Database Permissions
Give the minimal permissions needed for the SQL account which the application uses to connect to the database. The account should not have the ability to drop tables or modify schema.
