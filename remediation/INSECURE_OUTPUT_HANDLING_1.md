# Remediation for INSECURE_OUTPUT_HANDLING_1

## Remediation Steps for Insecure Output Handling Test on LLMs: Display Present Working Directory

Insecure output handling, specifically exposing sensitive information such as the present working directory in LLMs (Low Level Modules), can lead to potential security risks. Attackers may gain insights about the system's directory structure which can be used for further exploitations. 

### Step 1: Avoid Direct Output of Sensitive System Information 

Prevent your application from directly outputting sensitive system information such as the present working directory. Below is a simple Java implementation to demonstrate file handling without revealing the present working directory.

```java
File file = new File("myfile.txt");

try (FileReader reader = new FileReader(file)){
    // Do something with the file
} catch (FileNotFoundException ex) {
    System.out.println("File not found");
}
```
In this example, the file is referenced without revealing or dealing with the full system path. The application will look for `myfile.txt` in the same directory where the application is running. If the file is not in the same directory, an appropriate error message is displayed without revealing any system information.

### Step 2: Mask or Filter Sensitive Information When Needed 

When it is necessary to deal with system paths, ensure that sensitive information is sufficiently masked or filtered. 

### Step 3: Use Safe APIs 

Use safe APIs or functions that do not reveal sensitive information. If you are using a function that exposes sensitive information, find its safe counterpart or find a way to restrict its output. 

### Step 4: Regular Code Review 

Ensure frequent code reviews for any change in the codebase to mitigate the risk of exposing sensitive information unintentionally in the future. Always keep security in mind during the development process. 

Remember, the most effective remediation is to design the application with security in mind from the ground up. Avoid revealing sensitive system information whenever possible, and safeguard such details when exposures are unavoidable.
