# Remediation for WPCONFIG_AWS_KEY

## Remediation Steps for AWS S3 Keys Leak
AWS S3 keys leak is a serious security vulnerability as it allows unauthorized access to the content of the S3 buckets. This can happen if the S3 keys are exposed through code, configuration files, or any other mediums. Here are the remediation steps to handle this concern:

### Step 1: Identify the leaked keys
The first step is to identify the exposed keys and the buckets they relate to. This also includes identifying the resources and content that the keys provide access to.

### Step 2: Rotate the keys
```python
import boto3

aws_access_key_id = 'your_access_key'
aws_secret_access_key = 'your_secret_key'
client = boto3.client('iam', aws_access_key_id=aws_access_key_id, aws_secret_access_key=aws_secret_access_key)

response = client.create_access_key(
    UserName='iam_username'
)

print('New Access Key: ', response['AccessKey']['AccessKeyId'])
print('Secret Key: ', response['AccessKey']['SecretAccessKey'])

# Now you have new keys, delete the old keys
response = client.delete_access_key(
    UserName='iam_username',
    AccessKeyId='old_access_key_id'
)
```
### Step 3: Review and Update IAM Policies
Review and update IAM policies and ensure that the privileges assigned to the keys are minimally permissive i.e., the keys should only have access to the resources they need. 

### Step 4: Enable logging to track API requests
AWS S3 has logging capabilities that can be set up to log all access requests to your buckets. This includes requests made through the AWS Management Console, AWS SDKs, direct S3 API requests, etc.

### Step 5: Regular Audit and Update
Regular audits of AWS S3 keys in source code or configuration files can help prevent such leaks. You can also integrate a key management system like AWS Key Management Service (KMS) to automate the process of updating, storing, and using keys safely. 

**Note:** It is highly recommended to avoid hard-coding sensitive information like access keys in your code. Use safer alternatives like environment variables or AWS Secret Manager to store such information.
