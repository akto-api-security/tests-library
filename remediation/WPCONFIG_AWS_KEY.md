# Remediation for WPCONFIG_AWS_KEY

## Remediation Steps for AWS S3 Keys Leak
AWS S3 keys leak is a serious security vulnerability as it allows unauthorized access to the content of the S3 buckets. This can happen if the S3 keys are exposed through code, configuration files, or any other mediums. Here are the remediation steps to handle this concern:

### Step 1: Identify the leaked keys
The first step is to identify the exposed keys and the buckets they relate to. This also includes identifying the resources and content that the keys provide access to.

### Step 2: Rotate the keys
```python
import boto3

aws_access_key_id = 'your_access_key'
aws_secret_access_key = 'your_secret_key'
client = boto3.client('iam', aws_access_key_id=aws_access_key_id, aws_secret_access_key=aws_secret_access_key)

response = client.create_access_key(
    UserName='iam_username'
)

print('New Access Key: ', response['AccessKey']['AccessKeyId'])
print('Secret Key: ', response['AccessKey']['SecretAccessKey'])

# Now you have new keys, delete the old keys
response = client.delete_access_key(
    UserName='iam_username',
    AccessKeyId='old_access_key_id'
)
```
### Step 3: Review and Update IAM Policies
Review and update IAM policies and ensure that the privileges assigned to the keys are minimally permissive i.e., the keys should only have access to the resources they need.
