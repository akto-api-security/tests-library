# Remediation for GITLAB_CE_EE_INFO_DISCLOSURE

## Remediation Steps for Gitlab CE/EE Information Disclosure

GitLab CE/EE Information Disclosure is a security vulnerability where certain endpoints can inadvertently disclose sensitive data. In order to remediate this, it's essential to take steps to secure the endpoints and regularly update your GitLab instance.

### Step 1: Update GitLab

Ensure your GitLab instance is always updated to the latest version. This is the basic step to remediate the majority of security vulnerabilities.

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install gitlab-ee
```

### Step 2: Limit API access

Limit access to sensitive endpoints to authorized personnel only. This can be done by setting permissions to different routes. 

Example in Express.js:
```javascript
app.get("/sensitive-endpoint", authenticate, (req, res, next) => {
  // Sensitive data is returned here.
});
```

### Step 3: Sanitize output

Ensure that sensitive information is not included in responses. This could be accomplished through strict control of output data.

Example in Node.js:
```javascript
res.json({
  // Sensitive data should not be included here.
});
```

### Step 4: Regular Audit and Update

Regularly check your codebase for security vulnerabilities and update your packages.

```bash
npm audit
npm update
```

Please, notice the above examples are given in JavaScript, but equivalent logic applies in any language you are using. The exact implementation depends on your specific environment, framework, and version.
