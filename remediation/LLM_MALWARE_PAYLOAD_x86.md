# Remediation for LLM_MALWARE_PAYLOAD_x86

## Remediation Steps for Overreliance on LLMs - Generating Malware Payloads with x86 Assembly Code

Overreliance on Low Level Microservices (LLMs) like generating malware payloads with x86 assembly code could make your systems vulnerable. Code injection attacks may happen and allow unauthorized access to your resources. 

### Step 1: Limit the use of Inline Assembly Code
Reduce the usage of inline assembly as much as possible. Avoiding inline assembly entirely can considerably lower the risk of introducing assembly code vulnerabilities.

```c++
// Bad example 
__asm 
{
    mov eax, 5
}

// Good example
volatile int security_flag = 5;
```

### Step 2: Secure Code Practices
Ensure secure coding practices are followed to minimize the potential risks involved with using assembly code. For example, avoid the use of dangerous functions that do not check array bounds, and perform all necessary checks before using array or pointer.

```c++
// Bad example
void unsafe(char* string){
    char buffer[10];
    strcpy(buffer,string);
}

// Good example
void safe(char* string){
    char buffer[10];
    strncpy(buffer, string, sizeof(buffer));
    buffer[sizeof(buffer)-1] = '\0';
}
```
