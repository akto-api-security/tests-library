## Remediation Steps for VertaAI ModelDB Directory Traversal Test
Directory traversal is a vulnerability that allows attackers to access restricted directories by using the .. symbol to move into parent directories. For ModelDB, one way to mitigate such vulnerabilities is by enforcing strong input validation measures, especially in places where user-supplied input is used to access files or directories.

Here's a simple way to address this issue in Python.

### Step 1: Validate and sanitize user input
The first and crucial step is to adequately validate or sanitize the input you receive from users. Python provides many ways to validate file paths and filenames, but a simple method is using the `os.path` functions to ensure paths are safe.

```python
def secure_filename(path):
    secure_path = os.path.normpath(path)
    secure_path = os.path.join('/', secure_path)
    secure_path = secure_path.lstrip('/')
    return secure_path
```

In this example, the `os.path.normpath()` function converts a pathname to a normalized, absolute version, eliminating any symbolic links encountered in the path. Also, `os.path.join('/', path)` guarantees that the resolved path will not be outside of the intended directory tree.

### Step 2: Restrict user permissions
As a next step, you could ensure that your application runs with the least amount of privileges necessary. This principle, known as least privilege, prevents directory traversal attacks from being as damaging when they do occur. 

### Step 3: Use chroot jails or containers
If the above solutions are not enough, as a last resort, you could use a chroot jail or a container to isolate your application from the rest of your filesystem. This step is a more complex solution and might not be suitable for all situations.
