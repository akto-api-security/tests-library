## Remediation Steps for CSRF Login Attack

A CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) Login attack occurs when an attacker tricks the victim into submitting a malicious request. It involves an attacker forcing a victim's browser to send a request to a website with which the victim is authenticated, affecting the integrity and confidentiality of the victim's data.

### Step 1: Use Anti-CSRF Tokens

Implement anti-CSRF tokens in your application. These are unique tokens that validate that requests being made are from the authenticated user and not a third party. An anti-CSRF token can be implemented in the userâ€™s session or cookie.

```php
session_start();
if (empty($_SESSION['token'])) {
    $_SESSION['token'] = bin2hex(random_bytes(32));
}
```

### Step 2: Validate Tokens

Once you implemented tokens, you need to validate them. Compare the token in the user's session with the one that is received in the request.

```php
if (hash_equals($_SESSION['token'], $_POST['token'])) {
    // Proceed to process the form data
} else {
    // Log the CSRF attack attempt
}
```

### Step 3: Set 'SameSite' attribute for Cookies

Another great security feature is to set the 'SameSite' attribute for cookies. It restricts the browser from sending the cookie along with cross-site requests.

```php
header('Set-Cookie: key=value; SameSite=Strict');
```

### Step 4: Use HTTPOnly and Secure Flags for Cookies

Making a cookie `HTTPOnly` ensures that it's not accessible by JavaScript and can help to mitigate XSS attacks. The Secure flag ensures that the cookie is only sent over HTTPS and not accidentally leaked over HTTP.

```php
ini_set('session.cookie_httponly', 1);
ini_set('session.cookie_secure', 1);
```
