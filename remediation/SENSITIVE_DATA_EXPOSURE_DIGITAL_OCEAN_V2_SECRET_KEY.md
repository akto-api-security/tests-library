## Remediation Steps for Sensitive Data Exposure in Digital Ocean V2 Secret Key

Exposing sensitive data such as the Digital Ocean V2 Secret Key can lead to unauthorized access to your Digital Ocean resources. Here are the remediation steps to fix this vulnerability:

### Step 1: Rotate the Digital Ocean V2 Secret Key

Create a new Secret Key by navigating to the API section in your Digital Ocean dashboard and then generate a new token.

```python
# This is not an actual code. It's just represents the manual process you'll need to follow.
def rotate_secret():
    navigate_to("https://cloud.digitalocean.com/account/api/tokens")
    click_on("Generate New Token")
    copy_new_token()
rotate_secret()
```

### Step 2: Update your Application's Secret Key

Replace all instances of your old key in your application with the new key that you just generated. 

```python
# Assuming you're using an environment variable to store your secret key
import os
os.environ['DIGITAL_OCEAN_SECRET_KEY'] = 'your-new-secret-key'
```

### Step 3: Test your Application

After rotating the key, test your application to make sure everything works as expected.

```bash
# Use specific test command based on your application setup
# Example
pytest
```

### Step 4: Regularly Rotate Secret Keys

Consider setting a regular schedule (e.g., once every 3 months) to rotate your secret keys. 

### Step 5: Avoid committing sensitive data to Version Control Systems

Ensure sensitive data like Secret keys are not committed to public or insecure private repositories. Use environment variables or secret management systems to handle sensitive data.

One way to ensure this is to add a '.gitignore' file in your project root and include lines to ignore files or directories that might contain sensitive data.

```bash
# Add this in your .gitignore
*.env
secret_key.txt
/secret_directory/
```
