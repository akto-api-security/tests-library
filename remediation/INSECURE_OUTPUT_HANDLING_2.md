# Remediation for INSECURE_OUTPUT_HANDLING_2

## Remediation Steps for Insecure Output Handling in Local Least Privilege Services (LLMs): Remote Code Execution (RCE) with Terminal Command 

Insecure output handling can lead to RCE vulnerabilities, potentially allowing unauthorized users to execute commands in your environment. RCE vulnerabilities are serious, as they enable an attacker to take control over the affected system.
   
### Step 1: Input Validation and Sanitization

All user inputs should be appropriately sanitized. In general, programming languages offer built-in functions for this.

```python
import cgi
input = cgi.escape(user_input)
```

### Step 2: Least Privilege Principle

Run your applications with the least privileges they need to work properly. Login as a limited user instead of an administrator.

```bash
adduser --disabled-password --gecos "" limited_user
su - limited_user
```

### Step 3: Use Safe APIs 

When possible, prefer libraries or routines that can handle commands securely.

```python
import subprocess
subprocess.run(['ls', '-l'])
```

### Step 4: Use Parameterized Statements for SQL

Avoid SQL Injection by using parameterized queries or prepared statements. 

```python
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = %s AND password = %s", (user, password))
```

### Step 5: Regularly Update And Patch Systems

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
```

This is not an exhaustive set of steps and the requirements may vary based on the architecture of your system. Always make sure to consult relevant, up-to-date security resources when dealing with vulnerabilities.
