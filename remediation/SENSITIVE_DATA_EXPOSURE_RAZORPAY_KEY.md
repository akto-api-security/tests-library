# Remediation for SENSITIVE_DATA_EXPOSURE_RAZORPAY_KEY

## Remediation Steps for Sensitive Data Exposure (Razorpay Key)

Sensitive data exposure of the Razorpay Key is a serious security issue. Unauthorized exposure of this key can compromise the payment transactions data. You must ensure it is never exposed on the client-side code or any public repositories.

### Step 1: Remove the exposed key from code

```bash
# Using sed command to replace the exposed Razorpay Key in your source code files
sed -i 's/razorpay_key_1234/REPLACE_WITH_SECURED_KEY/g' path_to_your_code_file
```

### Step 2: Store the key securely

You should ideally store the Razorpay key in a secure environment variable or a secrets manager. Here's an example of how to set it up as an environment variable in a Node.js application.

```javascript
const razorpay = require('razorpay');

// Assuming your environment variable is named `RAZORPAY_KEY`
const key = process.env.RAZORPAY_KEY

const instance = new razorpay({
  key_id: key,
  key_secret: 'YOUR_SECRET'
});
```

### Step 3: Rotate your Razorpay Key

Log into your [Razorpay Dashboard](https://dashboard.razorpay.com/#/access/signin) and navigate to **Settings â†’ API Keys** to regenerate the compromised key.

**NOTE:** Remember, regenerating the key will invalidate the old key immediately. Make sure to update your environment variables or secret manager with the new key.

### Step 4: Review and Restrict access

Restrict access to the codebase to trusted individuals in your team. Continually review your access control and ensure only needed individuals have the right permissions.

### Step 5: Implement a solution like GitGuardian

Implement automated secrets scanning solution such as GitGuardian to help avoid future accidental commits of secrets and keys. You can add GitGuardian to your repositories as a pre-commit hook so it can scan and warn you before the secrets get committed.

### Step 6: Regular Audit 

Regularly check and update your security protocol. This includes regularly updating keys and secrets, refreshing access controls, and keeping an eye out for accidental commits of keys or secrets.

```bash
# Consider setting up a cron job to remind you of key rotations
0 0 1 * * echo "Remember to check and rotate your Razorpay keys" | mail -s "Monthly key audit" youremail@example.com
```

**IMPORTANT:** If your keys have been exposed, immediately contact Razorpay support to prevent potential misuse of your keys.
