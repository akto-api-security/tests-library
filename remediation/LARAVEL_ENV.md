# Remediation for LARAVEL_ENV

## Remediation Steps for Laravel - Sensitive Information Disclosure
Sensitive information disclosure from Laravel could potentially leak sensitive data associated with your application which can include user credentials and other private components of your application. To prevent this, it's important to ensure that app debugging is turned off in production and that error messages are logged instead of being displayed.

### Step 1: Disable Debug mode
Debug mode should not be used in your production application. It's important to turn this off to prevent potential information disclosure vulnerabilities. 
Debug mode can be disabled by setting the `APP_DEBUG` environment variable to `false` in your `.env` file.

```bash
APP_DEBUG=false
```
### Step 2: Configuring Error Detail

Configure your application to log error messages instead of displaying them. This can be done by setting the `APP_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable in your `.env` file to `error`.

```bash
APP_LOG_LEVEL=error
```
### Step 3: Use Middleware to Restrict Sensitive Routes

In your application, use middleware to restrict access to sensitive routes. This includes, but is not limited to, routes that return sensitive user or system information.

```php
Route::group(['middleware' => ['auth']], function () {
   // Your routes here
});
```
### Step 4: Regular Audit and Update

Keep your Laravel installation and packages up-to-date, and regularly review your application for any potential security issues.
