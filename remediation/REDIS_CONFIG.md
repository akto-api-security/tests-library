# Remediation for REDIS_CONFIG

## Remediation Steps for Redis Configuration File Exposure
Redis configuration file exposure is an important security issue. It occurs when Redis server configurations are left exposed, potentially allowing unauthorized users to exploit and tamper these settings, which can lead to unauthorized access or a security breach.

### Step 1: Secure Redis Configuration File
Make sure that the config file is only accessible by the Redis user. You can set the proper permissions using the `chmod` command.

```bash
sudo chmod 600 /etc/redis/redis.conf
```

### Step 2: Change bind to localhost or secure IP
Only bind Redis installations to localhost or a secure IP, thus reducing the exposure of the Redis instance to an external network.

```bash
# in redis.conf
bind 127.0.0.1
```
or alternatively you can bind it to a specific secure IP
```bash
# in redis.conf
bind YOUR_SECURE_IP
```

### Step 3: Set Protected Mode to "yes"
This setting makes sure Redis is not accessible from outside if no binding address is specified.

```bash
# in redis.conf
protected-mode yes
```

### Step 4: Set Authentication
Setting a strong password to the Redis Server and only allow authenticated users to communicate with the Redis Server.

```bash
# in redis.conf
requirepass YOUR_STRONG_PASSWORD
```

### Step 5: Regular Audit and Update
Make sure to update your Redis Server regularly for the latest security patches. Also, regularly perform an audit to find any potential security issues.

```bash
# Check Redis version
redis-server -v

# Update Redis
sudo apt-get install update
sudo apt-get install upgrade redis-server
```

Remember to replace `YOUR_STRONG_PASSWORD` with a secure password and `YOUR_SECURE_IP` with a valid IP address.
