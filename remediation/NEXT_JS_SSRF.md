# Remediation for NEXT_JS_SSRF

## Remediation Steps for Next.JS Server-Side Request Forgery

Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) is a safety issue where an attacker can manipulate the server to make requests on their behalf. In the context of Next.JS, this vulnerability could lead to the unauthorized exposure of internal assets and services.

### Step 1: Validate Incoming Requests

Make sure you validate incoming requests and their headers, sanitizing potential malicious content.

```javascript
import { IncomingMessage } from "http";

function isValidRequest(req: IncomingMessage) {
  if (typeof req.url !== 'string') {
    return false;
  }
  
  const url = new URL(req.url, 'http://localhost');
  
  // Validate the `url` here e.g., only accept specific hostname and paths
  return true;
}
```

### Step 2: Externalize and Limit Networking Access

Again, if you're implementing functionality allowing the server to make requests based on user input, limit which URLs are acceptable. Perhaps only allow a list of trusted domains or IP ranges.

```javascript
function requestUrl(url: URL) {
  if (!isTrustedUrl(url)) {
    throw new Error("URL is not trusted");
  }

  // Make the network request here
}

function isTrustedUrl(url: URL) {
  const trustedHosts = ["trusted.com", "secure-site.org"]; 
  return trustedHosts.includes(url.hostname);
}
```

### Step 3: Keep Dependencies Updated

Make sure all your dependencies are up to date. Often security patches will be implemented in later versions of software.

```bash
npm install
npm audit
npm audit fix
```

### Step 4: Apply Security Headers

Setting `X-Content-Type-Options` to `nosniff` prevents the browser from trying to MIME-sniff the content type and forces it to use the type given in the `Content-Type` header.

Setting `X-Frame-Options` to `SAMEORIGIN` can prevent your page from being embedded in an iframe in another site.

```javascript
function handler(req, res) {
  res.setHeader("X-Content-Type-Options", "nosniff");
  res.setHeader("X-Frame-Options", "SAMEORIGIN"); 
  // your handler code
}
```
### Step 5: Regular Audit and Update

Evaluate your application regularly for vulnerabilities, especially if it's exposed to the web.

```bash
npm audit
```
