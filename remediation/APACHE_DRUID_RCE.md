# Remediation for APACHE_DRUID_RCE

## Remediation Steps for Apache Druid Remote Code Execution

The issue of Remote Code Execution (RCE) in Apache Druid could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code remotely on vulnerable installations of Apache Druid. To remediate this vulnerability, follow the below steps:

### Step 1: Update Apache Druid to the latest version

The best solution to prevent the Remote Code Execution susceptibility in Apache Druid is to always use the latest version of Apache Druid. The vulnerability is fixed in the later versions. 

You can update your Apache Druid version with the following bash commands:

```bash
#Stop the current Druid Service
./bin/druid stop

#Backup your current Druid version
cp -R druid druid_backup

#Download and unpack the latest Druid Version
wget https://downloads.apache.org/druid/druid-0.21.1/apache-druid-0.21.1-bin.tar.gz
tar -xzf apache-druid-0.21.1-bin.tar.gz
mv apache-druid-0.21.1 druid

#Start the Druid service
./bin/druid start
```

_Replace 0.21.1 with the latest Apache Druid version._

### Step 2: Regular Audit and Update

It's also crucial to get notified about the latest vulnerabilities and updates, so regularly check the official Apache Druid website or the Apache mailing list for any updates or security patches.

```bash
#Check Apache Druid version
./bin/druid version
```

Always remember to backup your data before upgrading to a new version. 

_Remember that security is an ongoing process and it's always a good idea to regularly audit and update your application and the underlying infrastructure to stay a step ahead from potential attackers._
