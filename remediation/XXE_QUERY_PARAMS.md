# Remediation for XXE_QUERY_PARAMS

## Remediation Steps for XML External Entity (XXE) Vulnerability Test with URL Encoded Payload in API Endpoints

An XML External Entity attack is a type of attack against an application that parses XML input. API endpoints which do not properly disable the use of external entities can be vulnerable to the attack. The following steps can help remediate XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerabilities.

### Step 1: Disable External Entities

The best way to prevent against this kind of attack is to disable the use of external entities in XML altogether. Most XML parsers are vulnerable to XXE attacks by default.

Here's an example of how to disable this Xerces in Java.
```java
DocumentBuilderFactory dbf = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();
String FEATURE = null;

try {
    //Disable XXE
    FEATURE = "http://apache.org/xml/features/disallow-doctype-decl";
    dbf.setFeature(FEATURE, true);

    //If you can't completely disable DTDs
    FEATURE = "http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities";
    dbf.setFeature(FEATURE, false);

    //Disable external DTDs as well
    FEATURE = "http://xml.org/sax/features/external-parameter-entities";
    dbf.setFeature(FEATURE, false);

    //Disable external DTDs, entities as well as Schema
    FEATURE = "http://apache.org/xml/features/nonvalidating/load-external-dtd";
    dbf.setFeature(FEATURE, false);

    dbf.setXIncludeAware(false);
    dbf.setExpandEntityReferences(false);

} catch (ParserConfigurationException e) {
    // Handle the exception properly 
}
```

### Step 2: Use Less Complex Data Formats

If possible, use less complex data formats such as JSON, and avoid serialization of sensitive data.

### Step 3: Patch or Upgrade XML Processors and Libraries

The libraries used by an application to parse XML may be outdated. Updating these can help patch any known vulnerabilities that could be exploited.

### Step 4: Regular Security Audits

Implement regular security audits to catch any lapses in security and address them before they can be discovered by attackers.

_Remember that security is a dynamic field and what might be considered secure today could be found to have vulnerabilities tomorrow. Always keep up-to-date with the latest security best practices and ensure that they are implemented throughout your applications._
