# Remediation for GRAPHQL_DOS_DEFAULT_FIELD_OVERLOADING

## Remediation Steps for Denial of Service Test on GraphQL API with Default Field Overloading
Denial of Service (DoS) on GraphQL API with Default Field Overloading is a critical security issue. If GraphQL APIs are not properly protected, attackers can execute a DoS attack where the server resources are overloaded, significantly impacting the API availability.

### Step 1: Implement a Maximum Query Depth

You should establish a rule to limit maximum depth of each query to protect against malicious queries that may have a deep nested structure.
  
```javascript
const depthLimit = require('graphql-depth-limit')
const express = require('express');
const graphqlHTTP = require('express-graphql');
const schema = require('./schema');

const app = express();

app.use('/graphql', graphqlHTTP((request) => ({
  schema,
  validationRules: [depthLimit(10)], //let's say we agree on max depth of 10
})));

app.listen(3000);
```

### Step 2: Limiting Complexity and Amount of Requested Data

The idea here is to prevent queries that can request excessive amounts of data, like asking for the same field many times.

```javascript
const { createComplexityLimitRule } = require('graphql-validation-complexity');

app.use('/graphql', graphqlHTTP((request) => ({
  schema,
  validationRules: [createComplexityLimitRule(1000)],
})));
```
This will limit the total complexity to 1000 arbitrary units.

### Step 3: Timeout for Long Running Operations

To further prevent the server from being tied up indefinitely, you could set a timeout for queries. 

```javascript
app.use('/graphql', graphqlHTTP((request) => ({
  schema,
  validationRules: [depthLimit(10), createComplexityLimitRule(1000)],
  extensions({ document, variables, operationName, result }) {
    return { runTime: Date.now() - startTime }
  },
})));
```
This will ensure that any query that lasts more than the given time will timeout.
