# Remediation for LARAVEL_DEFAULT_HOMEPAGE_ENABLED

## Remediation Steps for Laravel Default Homepage Enabled
Having Laravel Default Homepage enabled could be a security issue. It can give the potential attacker insights about the technology in use, thus making it easier to craft targeted attacks.

### Step 1: Set up a custom route with a custom view
The default Laravel homepage route is defined in `routes\web.php`. You can remove or comment out the default Laravel welcome page route and replace it with your own desired route. Here's an example in PHP:

```php
// You should comment the default Laravel welcome view
// Route::get('/', function () {
//   return view('welcome');
// });

Route::get('/', function () {
  return view('your-view-name');
});
```

### Step 2: Create your custom view
Inside the `resources\views` directory, replace `your-view-name` from Step 1 with your view's filename. Presuming that your view's filename is `myhomepage.blade.php`, you can replace `your-view-name` with `myhomepage`.

```php
Route::get('/', function () {
  return view('myhomepage');
});
```

And you're done. Now instead of Laravel's default welcome page, Laravel will show the view you specified.

### Step 3: Regular Audit and Update
```bash
php artisan route:cache
php artisan config:cache
```

These commands will respectively cache the changes to the routes and configurations to ensure that the latest changes come into effect. Regularly audit and update your Laravel application to keep up with security best practices.
