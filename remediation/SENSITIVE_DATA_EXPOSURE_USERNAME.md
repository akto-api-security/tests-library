# Remediation for SENSITIVE_DATA_EXPOSURE_USERNAME

## Remediation Steps for Sensitive Data Exposure for USERNAME 

Sensitive data exposure is a critical security risk. Without proper protection, sensitive data like usernames, passwords and personal details can be exposed to attackers. Here, we are specifically addressing exposure of a username.

### Step 1: Sanitize and Validate User Input
Ensure user names and all user input is validated before processing. Use methods such as regex for validation.
```python
import re
def is_username_valid(username):
    return re.fullmatch(r'[A-Za-z0-9_]{3,20}', username) is not None
```
### Step 2: Use Parameterized Queries
Avoid SQL Injection by using parameterized queries. 
```python
import sqlite3
conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()
username = 'testUser' 
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username=?", (username,))
```
### Step 3: Encrypt Sensitive Data
Encrypt sensitive information like USERNAME using strong encryption algorithms like bcrypt when stored in database. 
```python
from flask_bcrypt import Bcrypt
bcrypt = Bcrypt()
hashed_password = bcrypt.generate_password_hash('password')
```
### Step 4: Implement Proper Error Handling
Avoid error messages that may leak any information about your infrastructure.
```python
try:
    cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username=?", (username,))
    user_records = cursor.fetchall()
except Exception as e:
    print("An error occurred.")
```
### Step 5: Grant Least Privilege
Ensure that accounts associated with USERNAME have least privilege, they should only have access to information and commands necessary for their legitimate purpose.

### Step 6: Regular Audit and Update
Keep your system, especially your database management software and your application dependencies, updated to the latest secure versions. And conduct regular security audits to ensure the continued security of sensitive information.
