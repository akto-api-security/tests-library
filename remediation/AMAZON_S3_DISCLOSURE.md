## Remediation Steps for Amazon S3 Key Disclosure

Amazon S3 Key Disclosure is a pressing security issue where unauthorized users may gain access to sensitive data stored on Amazon S3 buckets. To address this, it's vital to properly secure the S3 buckets and critically manage AWS access keys.

### Step 1: Revokes the disclosed access keys
Keys that have been disclosed must be immediately revoked. This can be done from the IAM Console.
```bash
aws iam delete-access-key --access-key-id AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE --user-name Bob
```

### Step 2: Create a new Access Key
After revoking the old keys, you should create new keys.
```bash
aws iam create-access-key --user-name Bob
```
Remember to store these new keys safely and do not disclose them.

### Step 3: Apply IAM roles for EC2 Instances
Avoid embedding access keys within your application. Instead, use IAM roles:

```python
import boto3
s3 = boto3.resource('s3')
for bucket in s3.buckets.all():
    print(bucket.name)
```

### Step 4: Implement proper bucket policies
Correctly configure your S3 bucket policies to limit access only to necessary services or users. This is done via S3 Console.

```json
{
  "Version":"2012-10-17",
  "Statement":[
    {
      "Sid":"AddPerm",
      "Effect":"Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action":["s3:GetObject"],
      "Resource":["arn:aws:s3:::examplebucket/*"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Step 5: Enable Amazon S3 server access logging
This helps track requests for access to your bucket for auditing purposes.
```bash
aws s3api put-bucket-logging --bucket my-bucket --bucket-logging-status file://logging.json
```
