# Remediation for BOLA_MODIFY_CUSTOM_HEADER_INTEGER_VAL_PATCH

## Remediation Steps for Exploiting BOLA by Fuzzing Custom Header with Integer for Unauthorized Access with PUT/PATCH based APIs

Exploiting BOLA (Broken Object Level Authorization)) is a serious security flaw. Attackers can manipulate object IDs sent via the URL or body parameters and may potentially perform unauthorized requests to your PUT or PATCH APIs.

### Step 1: Enforce Authorization Checks
Ensure that each API endpoint makes appropriate authorization checks to make sure that the user can only access data that they're supposed to.

```java
boolean authorized = checkAuthorization(user, objectId);
if (!authorized) {
    throw new UnauthorizedException("User does not have access to this object");
}
```

### Step 2: Validate Request Headers
The use of header manipulation or fuzzing should be treated as malicious behaviour. Using middleware or a similar solution, you can ensure that headers are as you expect them to be and drop requests which contain unexpected header values.

```java
if (!isValidHeader(request)) {
    throw new BadRequestException("Invalid request headers");
}
```

### Step 3: Strong ID Generation
Use random and unpredictable values for object IDs. This greatly reduces the chance that a malicious user will be able to guess a valid object ID.

```java
String objectId = UUID.randomUUID().toString();
```

### Step 4: Use of Rate Limiting 
Rate limiting can prevent an attacker from continually guessing object IDs. After a certain number of failed calls, you can lock out the user.

```bash
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -i eth0 -m state --state NEW -m recent --set
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -i eth0 -m state --state NEW -m recent --update --seconds 60 --hitcount 10 -j DROP
```

### Step 5: Regular Audit and Update
Keep track of your application logs and audit them regularly. Update your system and API in response to new vulnerability and threat reports.

```bash
tail -f /var/log/my-api.log;
//Update system regularly
sudo yum update -y
```

Note that the code snippets are illustrative and may need to be adjusted for your specific environment or language. Seek expert advice if you are unsure about implementation.
