# Remediation for ID_REPLACE_JSON_OBJECT_PATCH

## Remediation Steps for BOLA: Turning Parameters into JSON Objects for Unauthorized Access

BOLA (Binding of Layer Attack) is a security vulnerability typically found in APIs that accept JSON objects as input. It becomes dangerous when these flaws result in privilege escalation or unauthorized access. The following steps can be implemented to fix this.

### Step 1: Validate Input on Server Side

Always validate and sanitize incoming requests on the server side. Avoid any unsafe population of parameters passed on a PUT/PATCH request. Reject any unknown or extra properties.

```java
public class UserUpdateRequest {
   private String name;

   public void setName(String name) {
      this.name = name;
   }

   public String getName() {
      return this.name;
   }
}
```

### Step 2: Use Allowlist Input Validation

It's recommended to use an allowlist approach, where the client defines which fields to accept. If there are fields that are not supposed to be present, the API server should reject the request. 

```java
public class UserUpdateRequest {
   private String name;

   public void setName(String name){
      if(!allowedFields.contains(name)) {
         throw new BadRequestException();
      }
      this.name = name;
   }
}
```

### Step 3: Use Role-Based Access Control

Ensure proper Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). It ensures that only authorized users are given access to certain resources based on their roles.

```java
if(user.getRole() != Role.ADMIN) {
   throw new UnauthorizedException();
}
userUpdateRequest.processRequest();
```
