# Remediation for GRAPHQL_DOS_DEFAULT_FIELD_OVERLOADING_ALIAS

## Remediation Steps for Denial of Service on GraphQL API with Default Field Overloading Using Aliases
Denial of Service attacks on GraphQL APIs with default field overloading can be critical, causing disruptions to service. Attackers may overload specific resource-intense fields multiple times in a query by using aliases, leading to a significant impact on the performance. 

### Step 1: Limit the Complexity of GraphQL Queries
Limiting the complexity of queries can prevent the execution of overloaded queries. With this, a query's complexity is calculated, and if it exceeds a certain predefined threshold, the query is rejected with an error.
```javascript
const { createComplexityLimitRule } = require('graphql-validation-complexity');
const express = require('express');
const { ApolloServer } = require('apollo-server-express');
const typeDefs = require('./schema');
const resolvers = require('./resolvers');

const app = express();

const server = new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
  context: validationRules: [createComplexityLimitRule(1000)]
});

server.applyMiddleware({ app });

app.listen({ port: 4000 }, () =>
  console.log(`Server ready at http://localhost:4000${server.graphqlPath}`)
);
```
Replace 1000 with the limit that suits the specific needs and resources of your application.

### Step 2: Implement a Query Depth Limit
In addition to limiting the overall complexity, we can limit the depth of a single GraphQL query. This helps to prevent nested queries from consuming too many resources.
```javascript
const depthLimit = require('graphql-depth-limit')
const express = require('express');
const { ApolloServer } = require('apollo-server-express');
const typeDefs = require('./schema');
const resolvers = require('./resolvers');

const app = express();

const server = new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
  context: validationRules: [depthLimit(10)]
});

server.applyMiddleware({ app });

app.listen({ port: 4000 }, () =>
  console.log(`Server ready at http://localhost:4000${server.graphqlPath}`)
);
```
Again, replace 10 with the query depth that makes sense for your specific application.

### Step 3: Regular Audit and Update
Ensure that your GraphQL libraries and any related dependencies are kept up to date in order to take advantage of any potential security patches or fixes. Changes should be tested before deployment to ensure they do not break existing functionality.
```bash
npm update
```

### Step 4: Educate
Educate your development team about this vulnerability, its consequences, and prevention. Offer guidelines for writing queries and the rationale behind those guidelines, so developers can contribute to the security of your GraphQL API.

If these steps are implemented, the Denial of Service from GraphQL API with Default Field Overloading using Aliases can be mitigated. However, always ensure the security measures are updated as per the updates in your application and GraphQL.
