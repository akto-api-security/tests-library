## Remediation Steps for Sensitive Data Exposure for STREETLINE

Sensitive data exposure is a critical vulnerability where sensitive information is inadequately protected or exposed to unauthorized parties. Here are steps to implement to remediate this vulnerability:

### Step 1: Encrypt sensitive data
Encrypt all sensitive data during transmission and while at rest. 

For transmission, use HTTPS with SSL/TLS.

```java
URLConnection conn = url.openConnection();
if (conn instanceof HttpsURLConnection) {
  ((HttpsURLConnection)conn).setSSLSocketFactory(sslContext.getSocketFactory());
}
```

For data at rest, use appropriate algorithms like AES for encryption.

```java
Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding");
cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, secretKeySpec, ivParameterSpec);
byte[] encrypted = cipher.doFinal(plainText.getBytes("UTF-8"));
```

### Step 2: Minimize exposure of sensitive data
Store sensitive data only when necessary and remove it as soon as its purpose has been served.

```java
private void removeAllSensitiveData(User user) {
  user.setSensitiveInfo(null);
}
```

### Step 3: Implement Access Controls
Ensure proper access controls are in place to safeguard sensitive information from unauthorized access. Follow the principle of least privilege (PoLP).
