# Remediation for SENSITIVE_DATA_EXPOSURE_STREETLINE

## Remediation Steps for Sensitive Data Exposure for STREETLINE

Sensitive data exposure is a critical vulnerability where sensitive information is inadequately protected or exposed to unauthorized parties. Here are steps to implement to remediate this vulnerability:

### Step 1: Encrypt sensitive data
Encrypt all sensitive data during transmission and while at rest. 

For transmission, use HTTPS with SSL/TLS.

```java
URLConnection conn = url.openConnection();
if (conn instanceof HttpsURLConnection) {
  ((HttpsURLConnection)conn).setSSLSocketFactory(sslContext.getSocketFactory());
}
```

For data at rest, use appropriate algorithms like AES for encryption.

```java
Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding");
cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, secretKeySpec, ivParameterSpec);
byte[] encrypted = cipher.doFinal(plainText.getBytes("UTF-8"));
```

### Step 2: Minimize exposure of sensitive data
Store sensitive data only when necessary and remove it as soon as its purpose has been served.

```java
private void removeAllSensitiveData(User user) {
  user.setSensitiveInfo(null);
}
```

### Step 3: Implement Access Controls
Ensure proper access controls are in place to safeguard sensitive information from unauthorized access. Follow the principle of least privilege (PoLP).

### Step 4: Regular Audit and Update
Continually audit your systems and promptly apply security patches and updates to fix known vulnerabilities. Implement regular vulnerability scanning and penetration testing to identify and remediate potential weaknesses.

No matter the specifics of the vulnerability or the system in question, it is critically important to have a clear plan of action for addressing security vulnerabilities. A good remediation plan includes clear responsibilities and timelines, as well as a procedure for tracking progress. Regular testing and verification are crucial â€“ not only after the remediation is complete, but also on an ongoing basis to spot new vulnerabilities as they arise.
