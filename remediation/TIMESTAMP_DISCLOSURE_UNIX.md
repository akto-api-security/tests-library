## Remediation Steps for Timestamp Disclosure - Unix

Timestamp Disclosure is a security issue that can reveal important details like when a particular action occurred in a Unix system. This information leak can potentially be used by an attacker to understand the system and plan malicious activities. 

### Step 1: Enable 'noatime' in fstab
By default, Unix systems update the access timestamp whenever a file is read. This can be prevented by adding the 'noatime' setting in the '/etc/fstab' file for the respective partition.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/fstab
```
Look for your partition in the fstab file and add 'noatime' at the end of its corresponding line (before '0 0') separated by a space. Be careful not to delete or change any other text. If 'noatime' setting is already there, you don't need to add it. 

For instance if you have:
```bash
/dev/sda1  /  ext4  defaults  0 0
```
Update it as
```bash
/dev/sda1  /  ext4  defaults,noatime  0 0
```
Now save and close the file. Use Ctrl+x, then y and Enter to save and exit from the nano text editor.

### Step 2: Remounting Partitions
This will apply the new 'noatime' setting without needing to restart the system.
```bash
sudo mount -o remount /dev/sda1
```
Replace '/dev/sda1' with your partition name.

After the remediation steps, Unix will cease to update the access timestamp, mitigating the timestamp disclosure vulnerability.
