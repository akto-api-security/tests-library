# Remediation for IMPROPER_FLOAT_POINT_HANDLING

## Remediation Steps for Improper Float Point Handling

Improper Float Point Handling can lead to unexpected behaviors and potential security exploits. This issue often occurs due to precision errors when software fails to handle float point numbers correctly. A floating-point number has an integral part and a fractional part. Precision errors can occur during conversions from binary to decimal and vice versa. Taking steps to ensure proper handling of these data types can help rectify this issue.

### Step 1: Validate Float Point Inputs and Outputs
In your programming, always validate float inputs to ensure they are within expected ranges. This includes after calculations where precision loss might occur. 

```python
def validate_float(x):
    if not isinstance(x, float):
        raise ValueError('Input must be a floating point number')
    return x
```

### Step 2: Use Decimal instead of Float 
For Python, using the `Decimal` data type from the `decimal` library instead of `float` can help remedy some Math precision lost in calculations. 

```python
from decimal import Decimal 

def sum(a, b):
    a = Decimal(str(a))
    b = Decimal(str(b))
    sum = a + b
    return float(sum)
```

Although `Decimal` has a small performance cost, it can handle more precise values.

### Step 3: Use Fixed-Point Arithmetic Libraries

For languages that support it, consider using fixed point arithmetic libraries to avoid precision errors.
```csharp
// Using the Fixed library in C#
Fixed a = Fixed.From(10.25f);
Fixed b = Fixed.From(5.75f);
Fixed c = a + b;  // c = Fixed.From(16.0f);
```

### Step 4: Regular Code Review 
Ensure a regular code review process is in place to check for potential float point handling issues. This is beneficial not just for finding security issues, but for maintaining code quality overall.

```bash
# Granted you are using git as your SCM
git diff --name-only | while read FILE; do 
    if [[ $FILE == *.py ]]; then # for Python files
      pylint $FILE
    elif [[ $FILE == *.cs ]]; then # for C# files
      # assuming you have installed Visual Studio Code Analysis tools
      FxCopCmd.exe /file:$FILE /console
    fi
done
```
