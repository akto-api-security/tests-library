# Remediation for SPRING_CLOUD_RCE

## Remediation Steps for Spring Cloud Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

Spring Cloud RCE is a potential vulnerability that could allow unauthorized users to execute code remotely and gain unlawful control of the system.

We'll use Java as the source code language to remedy this vulnerability. It's imperative to ensure the version of the Spring Cloud Libray used is patched and not exposed to this exploit. 

### Step 1: Validate Your Spring Cloud Library Version
Identify the current version of Spring Cloud library used in your project. A vulnerable version could expose your application to the risk of a Remote Code Execution attack. 

You can usually find the version number in your project's `pom.xml` or `build.gradle` file.

### Step 2: Update Spring Cloud Library version
If your current Spring Cloud version is vulnerable, update your library version to the latest patched one. Modify your `pom.xml` or `build.gradle` file to incorporate the updated version.

#### In Maven (`pom.xml`), add/update:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter</artifactId>
    <version>VERSION_NUMBER</version>
</dependency>
```

#### In Gradle (`build.gradle`), add/update:
```groovy
compile group: 'org.springframework.cloud', name: 'spring-cloud-starter', version: 'VERSION_NUMBER'
```
Replace 'VERSION_NUMBER' with the most recent, patched Spring Cloud version.

### Step 3: Build and Deploy
After updating the library version, rebuild your code and deploy it.

```bash
# For Maven
mvn clean install

# For Gradle
gradle build
```
### Step 4: Regular Audit and Update
Consistently monitor any disclosed vulnerabilities in the libraries your software relies on and update them promptly. Modify your `pom.xml` or `build.gradle` periodically with the newer versions released.

Please note that this process is not a definitive fix to the vulnerability, but a recommended mitigation strategy. It's crucial that all software dependencies stay updated as a rule to maintain robust security.
