# Remediation for QUERY_PARAM_BOMBING_DOS

## Remediation Steps for Denial of Service Attacks via Query Parameters

Denial of Service (DoS) attacks can overwhelm a server by sending a flood of requests, often via various query parameters in a request. This can disrupt the server's ability to handle legitimate requests.

### Step 1: Use a Load Balancer

Many load balancers offer built-in protections against DoS attacks. Having a load balancer in place can help distribute the incoming traffic and reduce the risk of a single server being overwhelmed.

### Step 2: Limit Request Rate 

Limit the rate of incoming requests from an individual IP address. This can help prevent a single source from sending an overwhelming number of packets.

```python
from flask_limiter import Limiter
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)
limiter = Limiter(app, key_func=get_remote_address)

@limiter.limit("10/minute")  # Change limit rate to suit your need
@app.route('/')
def hello():
  return "Hello World!"

```

### Step 3: Input Validation

To prevent exploitation of specific query parameters, it's essential to validate input. Ensure the authenticity of incoming requests and sanitize input data.

```python
from flask import request

@app.route('/')
def home():
    username = request.args.get('username')
    if not username or not username.isalnum():
        abort(400, 'Invalid username provided.')
```
