## Remediation Steps for BOLA Exploitation Using Integer IDs in URL Path 
BOLA (Broken Object Level Authorization) exploits can be a severe security issue when combined with DELETE operations in an unsecured API. Malicious users may manipulate the application by directly accessing the API's object IDs. Here's how you can address this vulnerability. 

### Step 1: Implement Proper Authorization Checks
Ensure that each action permitted by the API includes appropriate authorization checks to prevent unauthorized access. 

```java
@RequestMapping(value = "/api/item/{id}", method = RequestMethod.DELETE)
public String deleteItem(@PathVariable("id") Integer id, Principal principal) {
    // Fetch user's roles/permissions
    Set<Permission> permissions = fetchPermissions(principal.getName());

    // Check if user has DELETE permission
    if(permissions.contains(Permission.DELETE)) {
        // Delete item 
        itemService.delete(id);
        return "Item deleted successfully";
    } else {
        throw new AccessDeniedException("You do not have necessary permission to perform this action");
    }
}
```

### Step 2: Utilize UUID instead of Integer IDs
UUIDs are far more difficult to guess compared to integer IDs, providing added security through their complexity.

```java
@RequestMapping(value = "/api/item/{uuid}", method = RequestMethod.DELETE)
public String deleteItem(@PathVariable("uuid") UUID uuid, Principal principal) {
    // perform authorization check and deletion as above
}
```

### Step 3: Rate Limiting
Implement rate limiting to prevent/ban users who make an unusual number of API requests.

```python
from flask_limiter import Limiter
from flask import Flask

# setup rate limiting
limiter = Limiter(
    key_func=get_remote_address,
    default_limits=["200 per day", "50 per hour"]
)

app = Flask(__name__)
limiter.init_app(app)

@app.route('/api/item/<uuid>', methods=['DELETE'])
@limiter.limit('5/minute')  # limit this specific route
def delete(uuid):
    # perform authorization check and deletion 
```

### Step 4: Logging & Monitoring
Ensure all DELETE requests are logged and monitored for unusual activity. If you detect repeated failed attempts, consider blocking the IP from which the attempts originate.

```java
@RequestMapping(value = "/api/item/{id}", method = RequestMethod.DELETE)
public String deleteItem(@PathVariable("id") Integer id, Principal principal) {
    //...code

    // Log DELETE request 
    logger.log(Level.INFO, "DELETE request from: " + principal.getName() + " for item: " + id);

    //...code
}
```
