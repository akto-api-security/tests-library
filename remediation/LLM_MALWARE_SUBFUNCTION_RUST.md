# Remediation for LLM_MALWARE_SUBFUNCTION_RUST

## Remediation Steps for Overreliance on LLMs - Generating Malware Subfunctions with Rust
Overreliance on LLMs - Lower Level Modules, when generating Malware subfunctions with Rust, can lead to unforeseen security issues. An attacker may exploit this by injecting malicious code into these subfunctions, therefore causing harm to your system. Below are the required remediation steps:

### Step 1: Code Review
Review your current Rust code. Ensure that your code is clean and properly using the LLMs.

```rust
// A placeholder for your Rust code
fn hello_world() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

### Step 2: Avoid Excessive Use of LLMs
Limit the use of Lower Level Modules (LLMs) in your Rust codebase. Only introduce them when necessary and not for trivial tasks that can be resolved with safer and easier-to-use constructs.

```rust
// A placeholder for your Rust code
fn more_secure_code() {
    // Avoid using unsecure LLMs here
}
```

### Step 3: Input Validation 
Ensure that you're validating every piece of user input before it's processed by any subfunction.

```rust
fn validate_input(input: &str) -> bool {
    // Add your validation logic here
    return true;
}
```
