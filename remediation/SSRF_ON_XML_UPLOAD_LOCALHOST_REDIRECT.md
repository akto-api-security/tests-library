## Remediation Steps for SSRF Exposing Sensitive Localhost Details

SSRF (Server Side Request Forgery) can be used by attackers to interact with internal systems behind firewalls that may not be directly accessible. If an attacker can create or control requests from the vulnerable server, it can lead to serious issues such as the one described above. We will use Python for the source code here. 

### Step 1: Validate and sanitize inputs

The foremost step is to validate and sanitize any user-provided inputs to make sure that unexpected values do not cause security problems. 

```python
def sanitize_input(user_input):
    # Add input sanitizing logic here
    sanitized_input = user_input.replace('localhost', '')  # Just an example, there should be more robust sanitizing logic
    return sanitized_input
```

### Step 2: Avoid Blind Redirection

As this vulnerability involves redirecting the XML param, it is crucial to avoid blind redirection.

```python
def redirect(destination):
    allowed_destinations = ['destination1', 'destination2']  # List of allowed redirections
    if destination in allowed_destinations:
        # Perform the redirection
    else:
        raise ValueError("Invalid destination")
```

### Step 3: Use a Allowlist approach

Only respond to requests from known sources to make sure that no unexpected sources are sending the requests.

### Step 4: Rate Limiting

Make sure that your application employs rate limiting to prevent attackers from sending too many requests in a short period of time.
