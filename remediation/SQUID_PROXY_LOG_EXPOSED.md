## Remediation Steps for Squid Proxy Log Exposure

Squid Proxy log exposure can present serious security risks as it might contain sensitive information. Following are the steps you can take to mitigate the risk.

### Step 1: Implement Access Control
You can use file permission and ownership to restrict access to the squid log file.

```bash
sudo chown proxy:proxy /var/log/squid/access.log
sudo chmod 640 /var/log/squid/access.log
```

### Step 2: Log Rotation
Implement log rotation to manage log file size and avoid unnecessary exposure of information. Below is a basic sample of Squid log rotation configuration in logrotate.d:

```bash
/var/log/squid/*.log {
    daily
    missingok
    rotate 14
    compress
    delaycompress
    notifempty
    create 0640 proxy proxy
    sharedscripts
    postrotate
        /usr/sbin/squid -k rotate
    endscript
}
```

### Step 3: Monitoring and Audit
Regularly monitor and audit your squid logs. If possible use automated scanning and security notification mechanism to detect any unwanted access.

```bash
sudo tail -f /var/log/squid/access.log
```

### Step 4: Use Firewall 
Implement firewall rules to restrict remote access to your server.

```bash
sudo ufw deny from any to any port 3128
```

### Step 5: Encrypt Traffic
Encrypting your proxy traffic can add an additional layer of security. You can consider using Squid with SSL.
```bash
http_port 3128 ssl-bump generate-host-certificates=on dynamic_cert_mem_cache_size=4MB cert=/etc/squid/ssl_cert/myCA.pem
```
