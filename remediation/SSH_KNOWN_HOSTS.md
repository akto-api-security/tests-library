# Remediation for SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS

## Remediation Steps for SSH Known Hosts Vulnerability
The SSH Known Hosts vulnerability occurs when an attacker can gain unauthorized access to your system by manipulating the known hosts file. It is important to regularly maintain and update the SSH known hosts file to prevent SSH spoofing or man-in-the-middle attacks.

### Step 1: Update and Upgrade System
Ensure your system is up-to-date with all the latest patches and updates.
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
```
### Step 2: Clean Up the Known Hosts File
Remove old or unused entries from your known_hosts file to reduce risk.
```bash
ssh-keygen -R hostname
```
Replace 'hostname' with the name or IP address of the host you want to remove.

### Step 3: Enable Strict Host Checking
To prevent SSH from automatically adding new hosts to the known_hosts file, enable StrictHostKeyChecking.
```bash
echo "StrictHostKeyChecking ask" | sudo tee -a /etc/ssh/ssh_config
```
This prompts users before adding new hosts, providing an extra layer of security.

### Step 4: Regularly Monitor and Maintain the Known Hosts File
Conduct regular audits and updates of your known_hosts file. This ongoing maintenance can help to minimize your systemâ€™s exposure to SSH spoofing or other similar attacks.
```bash
nano ~/.ssh/known_hosts
```
Regular auditing of the records in this file ensures they are all known and trusted.

### Step 5: Enable Host Key Rotation
Host key rotation can add another protection layer. Enable it by adding the following to your sshd_config.
```bash
echo "HostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key" | sudo tee -a /etc/ssh/sshd_config
echo "HostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key" | sudo tee -a /etc/ssh/sshd_config
echo "HostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key" | sudo tee -a /etc/ssh/sshd_config
echo "HostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key" | sudo tee -a /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```
Finally, restart the SSHD service.
```bash
sudo service sshd restart
```
Regularly rotate and prune your SSH host keys to mitigate against an attacker who has potentially obtained private keys by exploiting other system vulnerabilities.
