# Remediation for XXE_BASIC_SOAP_API_INJECTION

## Remediation Steps for XML External Entity (XXE) Test for Basic SOAP API Injection

XML External Entity (XXE) Injection is a type of attack against an application that parses XML input. This attack occurs when XML input containing a reference to an external entity is processed by a weakly configured XML parser. This attack may lead to the disclosure of confidential data, denial of service, and other critical system impacts.

### Step 1: Disable DTDs (Document Type Definitions)

The first step to stop XXE attacks is to disable DTDs in your XML parser, as they are rarely needed in modern applications.

In Java, you would do this as follows:

```java
DocumentBuilderFactory dbf = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();
dbf.setFeature("http://apache.org/xml/features/disallow-doctype-decl", true);
```

### Step 2: Disable External Entities in XML 

The next step is to disable the use of external entities in XML. 

For Java, you can do this by:

```java
dbf.setFeature("http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities", false);
dbf.setFeature("http://xml.org/sax/features/external-parameter-entities", false);
dbf.setFeature("http://apache.org/xml/features/nonvalidating/load-external-dtd", false);
```

### Step 3: Update XML Parsers

Stay up-to-date with the latest version of your XML parser software. Updates often come with patches for known vulnerabilities such as XXE injection.

### Step 4: Implement Positive Server-Side Input Validation

Implement strict input validation using a whitelist approach, thereby eliminating potentially harmful input.
