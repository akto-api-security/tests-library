## Remediation Steps for Canadian Social Insurance Number Exposure
Sensitive data exposure, such as Canadian Social Insurance Number (SIN), is a critical security issue that needs to be addressed immediately. Unauthorized access to the SINs could lead to identity theft and other serious consequences.

### Step 1: Data Masking
Mask SIN during logging and display, except for the last 4 digits.
```java
public String maskSIN(String sin) {
    return sin.replaceAll("^(\\d{5}).*", "*****$1");
}
```
### Step 2: Sensible Storage
Store SIN data in a secure manner, possibly using encryption. Here's an example in Python using `cryptography` library.
```python
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet

def encrypt_data(sin, key):
    cipher_suite = Fernet(key)
    encoded_sin = sin.encode('utf-8')  # encoding the data
    encrypted_sin = cipher_suite.encrypt(encoded_sin)
    return encrypted_sin

def decrypt_data(encrypted_sin, key):
    cipher_suite = Fernet(key)
    decrypted_sin = cipher_suite.decrypt(encrypted_sin)
    return decrypted_sin.decode('utf-8')  # decoding the data
```
### Step 3: Use Secure Communication Channels
Always make sure that the transmission of SINs is done over secure channels (like HTTPS).
```bash
openssl req -new -newkey rsa:4096 -days 365 -nodes -x509  -keyout server.key -out server.crt
```
