## Remediation Steps for Reposilite Directory Traversal Test

The Reposilite Directory Traversal vulnerability would allow an attacker to traverse directories from the exposed endpoint. To remediate this, follow the steps outlined below.

### Step 1: Update Reposilite
Ensure that your Reposilite version is up to date. This Directory Traversal vulnerability is fixed in the latest version. 

To update Reposilite, run the following command to download the latest version:

```bash
wget https://github.com/dzikoysk/reposilite/releases/download/{latest-reposilite-version}/reposilite.jar
```
Replace `{latest-reposilite-version}` with the latest Reposilite version.

### Step 2: Configure Reposilite 

After updating, ensure that your Reposilite is properly configured for issues concerning the restriction of access. 

The `reposilite.cdn` section of the `reposilite.yml` configuration file should look similar to this:

```bash
reposilite {
  cdn {
    enabled = true
    headers = { }
    index = "index.html"
    error = "404.html"
  }
}
```
