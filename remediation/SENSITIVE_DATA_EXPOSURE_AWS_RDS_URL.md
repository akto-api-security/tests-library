# Remediation for SENSITIVE_DATA_EXPOSURE_AWS_RDS_URL

## Remediation Steps for Sensitive data exposure for AWS RDS URL

Sensitive data exposure is a serious security issue in AWS RDS. If AWS RDS URL is exposed, attackers can potentially have unauthorized access to your RDS instances.
### Step 1: Remove AWS RDS URL from Source Code
Ensure that the RDS URL is not embedded in your source code.
```java
// BAD
String dbUrl = "jdbc:mysql://rds-instance-url.amazonaws.com:3306/myDatabase";

// GOOD
String dbUrl = System.getenv("DB_URL");
```
### Step 2: Use Environment Variables
Instead of including the RDS URL in your code, set it as an environment variable on your AWS instances.
```bash
export DB_URL="jdbc:mysql://your-rds-instance-url.amazonaws.com:3306/myDatabase"
```
### Step 3: Store Sensitive Data in AWS Secrets Manager
For an added layer of security, consider using Amazon's Secrets Manager service which is designed to protect access to your applications, services, and IT resources.
```python
import boto3
from botocore.exceptions import BotoCoreError, ClientError

def get_secret():
    secret_name = "MySecretName"
    region_name = "us-west-2"
    session = boto3.session.Session()
    client = session.client(
        service_name='secretsmanager',
        region_name=region_name
    )
    try:
        get_secret_value_response = client.get_secret_value(SecretId=secret_name)
        return get_secret_value_response['SecretString']
    except Exception as e:
        print(e)
        raise e

DB_URL = get_secret()
```
### Step 4: Regular Audit and Update
Monitor your application's connections regularly. Ensure that your RDS instances are not publicly accessible except for specific IP ranges as required. Review and rotate your secrets regularly.
```bash
aws rds describe-db-instances --query 'DBInstances[*].[DBInstanceIdentifier,PubliclyAccessible]'
```
