## Remediation Steps for Sensitive Data Exposure for GITHUB ACCESS

Sensitive data exposure, especially GitHub access, can lead to unauthorized access to the code repository, including code, data, application environment, and infrastructure. Here are the steps to mitigate the issue:

### Step 1: Remove Exposed Access Token

Firstly you should revoke the compromised access token from your GitHub account. To do that,

```bash
# Login to GitHub Account -> Settings -> Developer Settings -> Personal access tokens
# Select the compromised token and click on 'Revoke'
```
### Step 2: Generate New Access Token

 After revoking the compromised access token, generate a new one and replace it wherever needed.

  ```bash
  # Login to GitHub Account -> Settings -> Developer Settings -> Personal access tokens
  # Click on 'Generate new token'
  # Provide necessary permissions as per the requirements and generate the token
  ```

### Step 3: Secure your GitHub Access

Avoid keeping your access token in your code. It's better to use environment variables. When you use public repositories, ensure that you set "gitignore" to prevent sharing tokens, passwords, and other sensitive data.

```bash
# Set Environment Variable in local
export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token_here
# Use Environment Variable in your application
token = os.environ.get('GITHUB_TOKEN')
```

### Step 4: Monitoring and Logging

Implement logging and monitoring mechanism to detect unauthorized access to your GitHub repositories.
