# Remediation for JMX_CONSOLE_EXPOSED

## Remediation Steps for JMX Console Exposure
JMX Console exposure is a serious security problem that can lead to remote code execution and unauthorized access to sensitive data. Protecting the JMX console is necessary to ensure security.

### Step 1: Disable JMX Remote
Initially, we must disable the remote JMX in your Java based server. Here is an example on how to do it in the JVM startup parameters:

```bash
-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote=false
```
This step is usually enough to prevent unauthorized JMX connections to your server.

### Step 2: Enable Authentication and SSL in JMX server
Next, make sure to enable the authentication and SSL for JMX server. You can do this by editing your `java.security` file:

```bash
-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=true
-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=true
-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.password.file=/path/to/password.file
-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.access.file=/path/to/access.file
```

### Step 3: Firewall Measures
Block access to JMX default port (usually 1099 or 9010) in the firewall. This is specific to the type of firewall you are using. For example with UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall):

```bash
sudo ufw deny from any to any port 1099
sudo ufw deny from any to any port 9010
```
