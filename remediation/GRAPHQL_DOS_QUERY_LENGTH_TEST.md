## Remediation Steps for Denial of Service Test on GraphQL API with Very Long Query Name

A Denial of Service (DoS) attack can overwhelm a server by sending a large amount of data or requests at once. In this case, the attacker is sending very long query names to the GraphQL API, potentially leading to a DoS. 

### Step 1: Set Maximum Query Depth

Firstly, you should define a maximum query depth to protect the server from receiving requests that are too deep and complex.

```javascript
const depthLimit = require('graphql-depth-limit');
const {createServer} = require('http');
const express = require('express');
const graphqlHTTP = require('express-graphql');
const { schema } = require('./schema');

const app = express();

app.use(
  '/graphql',
  graphqlHTTP({
    schema,
    validationRules: [depthLimit(7)], // setting max query depth
  })
);

const server = createServer(app);

server.listen(4000);
```

### Step 2: Set Maximum Query Length

Next, implement a length check on the received query name. Below is an example of how to do this in an Express middleware before the request hits your GraphQL Endpoint.

```javascript
app.use('/graphql', (req, res, next) => {
  if (req.query && req.query.length > 2000) { 
    res.status(413).send('Query too long'); // change 2000 to your desired maximum length
  } else {
    next();
  }
});
```

### Step 3: Define Cost Analysis Rules

By defining a complexity cost to operations in your GraphQL Schema, it discourages exceptionally large queries from being made.

```javascript
const { createComplexityLimitRule } = require('graphql-validation-complexity');

app.use(
  '/graphql',
  graphqlHTTP({
    schema,
    validationRules: [createComplexityLimitRule(1000)], // setting maximum query complexity
  })
);
```

### Step 4: Handle Exceptions Gracefully

If an extremely long query name somehow slips through your defenses and causes an error, ensure your server handles exceptions gracefully and doesn't crash.

```javascript
app.use(function (err, req, res, next) {
  console.error(err.stack)
  res.status(500).send('Request failed due to server error');
})
```
