## Remediation Steps for Sensitive Data Exposure (PHONE NUMBER)
Sensitive data like phone numbers should never be exposed to unauthorized parties. It is crucial to protect sensitive data throughout its entire lifecycle (in transit, at rest, and during processing).

### Step 1: Use a Secure Method to Store Phone Numbers
Avoid storing phone numbers in plain text. Leverage modern encryption methods like AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) to ensure your phone numbers are safe. The following Java code encrypts the phone number:

```java
import javax.crypto.Cipher;
import javax.crypto.spec.SecretKeySpec;
import java.util.Base64;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        String phone = "1234567890";
        String key = "ThisIsASecretKey";
        SecretKeySpec secretKey = new SecretKeySpec(key.getBytes(), "AES");
        Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES");
        cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, secretKey);
        String encryptedPhone = Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(cipher.doFinal(phone.getBytes()));
        System.out.println(encryptedPhone); // Print encrypted phone number
    }
}
```

### Step 2: Mask Phone Numbers in User Interfaces
If you need to present the phone number to the user, consider masking part of the phone number. 

### Step 3: Secure Data Transmission
If transmitting phone numbers, always use HTTPS with TLS encryption rather than plain HTTP, ensuring the data is encrypted during transmission.


### Step 4: Access Control
Strictly control and monitor who can access the sensitive data. Role-based access control (RBAC) may be helpful in this case. Enable logging to track down in case of any security breach.
