## Remediation Steps for Mass Assignment Coupon Expiry Validation
Mass Assignment is a widespread vulnerability that occurs when too many user-controlled fields are exposed in applications. In the context of a coupon expiry validation, an attacker could exploit this to change the expiration date of a coupon. 

### Step 1: Private and Strong Parameters
You should make certain attributes private so that they cannot be easily manipulated.

For example, in Ruby on Rails:

```ruby
class CouponController < ActionController::Base
  private
  
  def coupon_params
    params.require(:coupon).permit(:title, :discount, :expiry_date)
  end
end
```
Here, we've made the coupon parameter's attributes a private method to prevent mass assignment.

### Step 2: Input Validation
Next, you should enforce validation for the `expiry_date` field to ensure the input is in the correct format and within specific bounds.

For instance, you can use Java's `LocalDate` method:

```java
public class Coupon {
  private LocalDate expiryDate;
  // Setter
  public void setExpiryDate(LocalDate expiryDate) {
    if(expiryDate.isAfter(LocalDate.now()) {
      this.expiryDate = expiryDate;
    } else {
      System.out.println("Invalid expiry date!");
    }
  }
}
```

This ensures that the expiry date can't be set to a date in the past.
