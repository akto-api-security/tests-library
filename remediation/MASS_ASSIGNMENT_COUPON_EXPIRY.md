# Remediation for MASS_ASSIGNMENT_COUPON_EXPIRY

## Remediation Steps for Mass Assignment Coupon Expiry Validation
Mass Assignment is a widespread vulnerability that occurs when too many user-controlled fields are exposed in applications. In the context of a coupon expiry validation, an attacker could exploit this to change the expiration date of a coupon. 

### Step 1: Private and Strong Parameters
You should make certain attributes private so that they cannot be easily manipulated.

For example, in Ruby on Rails:

```ruby
class CouponController < ActionController::Base
  private
  
  def coupon_params
    params.require(:coupon).permit(:title, :discount, :expiry_date)
  end
end
```
Here, we've made the coupon parameter's attributes a private method to prevent mass assignment.

### Step 2: Input Validation
Next, you should enforce validation for the `expiry_date` field to ensure the input is in the correct format and within specific bounds.

For instance, you can use Java's `LocalDate` method:

```java
public class Coupon {
  private LocalDate expiryDate;
  // Setter
  public void setExpiryDate(LocalDate expiryDate) {
    if(expiryDate.isAfter(LocalDate.now()) {
      this.expiryDate = expiryDate;
    } else {
      System.out.println("Invalid expiry date!");
    }
  }
}
```

This ensures that the expiry date can't be set to a date in the past.

### Step 3: Regular code review and testing
Regularly review and test your code to ensure that no fields are mass assignable and that your security methods continue to be effective. For automated testing, you can use tools like Brakeman for Rails or OWASP ZAP for general web applications.

### Step 4: Secure Coding Practices
Encourage secure coding practices among your developers to minimize potential vulnerabilities. 

Remember, JavaScript, and Python, among other languages, can also be secured against Mass Assignment by following similar principles. No remedy fits all situations and different applications may need different methods.
