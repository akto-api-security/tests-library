## Remediation Steps for Overreliance on LLMs - Generating Malware Payloads with C++
Overreliance on Low-Level Metaprogramming (LLMs) in C++ can create vulnerabilities, especially while generating malware payloads, leading to potential security threats.

### Step 1: Avoid Overreliance on LLMs
Invoke higher-level programming constructs to remove reliance on LLMs, reducing the chances of generating malware payloads.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

// Use higher-level constructs like std::vector instead of low-level arrays
std::vector<int> payload;

// Function handling secure assignment to the vector
void secureAssign(std::vector<int> &payload, int value, int index) {
    if (index >= 0 && index < payload.size()) {
        payload[index] = value; // secure assignment
    } else {
        std::cout << "Error: Assignment Index Out of Bounds\n";
    }
}
```
