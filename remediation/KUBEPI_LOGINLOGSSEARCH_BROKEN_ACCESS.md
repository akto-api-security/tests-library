## Remediation Steps for KubePi LoginLogsSearch Unauthorized Access

Unauthorized access to KubePi `LoginLogsSearch` could potentially expose sensitive information related to clients' login logs, which might be utilized by attackers. 

### Step 1: Verify Authentication 
Ensure that user authentication is enabled and checks are implemented at each request. 

```python
from flask_login import login_required

@app.route('/login_logs_search/')
@login_required
def login_logs_search():
    pass
```

### Step 2: Set Authorization roles
Implement authorization roles to ensure that only authorized roles can search the login logs.

```python
from flask_user import roles_required

@app.route('/login_logs_search/')
@roles_required('admin')    # Use of Flask-User roles required
def login_logs_search():
    pass
```

This will restrict access to only users with 'admin' role.

### Step 3: Use HTTPS
Ensure that your application is served over HTTPS. This helps to encrypt the data between the client and the server, preventing man-in-the-middle attacks.

### Step 4: Configure RBAC in Kubernetes
Configure Kubernetes RBAC (Role-Based Access Control), and apply least privilege principle.

```yaml
kind: Role
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  namespace: default
  name: log-reader
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["pods", "pods/log"]
  verbs: ["get", "list"]
---
kind: RoleBinding
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: read-logs
  namespace: default
subjects:
- kind: User
  name: admin   # Name is case sensitive
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef:
  kind: Role
  name: log-reader
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```
