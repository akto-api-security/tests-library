# Remediation for SENSITIVE_DATA_EXPOSURE_IMAGE

## Remediation Steps for Sensitive Image Data Exposure

Sensitive image data exposure is a serious security issue. Leaked image data might contain personal or confidential information. Here are steps to prevent the exposure of image data.

### Step 1: Serve Images through Authorised Routes
Images should be served through routes that require proper authorisation. For instance, in Node.js one might use express-static to serve static files securely. Here, replace the `public_url` with your protected route and `image_path` with path to your images.

```javascript
var express = require('express');
var app = express();
var path = require('path');

app.use('public_url', isAuthenticated, express.static('image_path'));
```

### Step 2: Implement Proper Access Control
Ensure the application implements proper access control on these routes. This can be done by implementing an `isAuthenticated` middleware function in express before serving any content.

```javascript
function isAuthenticated(req, res, next) {
  if (req.isAuthenticated()) { 
    return next(); 
  }
  res.redirect('/login');
}
```

### Step 3: Save Images in Obscure Locations
Save images not directly in the webroot, but in a location outside of it that isn't directly accessible. Direct references to files should not be predictable or enumerable.

### Step 4: Regularly Update Security Patches
Ensure to regularly update your server and software to the latest versions, this includes security patches that might be critical to preventing data breaches.

Please note, that all these steps are generally necessary but they may not all be applicable in your situation. Tailor the solution to suit your specific requirements and context.
