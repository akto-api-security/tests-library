## Remediation Steps for Command Injection by Variable Assignment

Command Injection by variable assignment is a serious security risk where an attacker can inject malicious commands that could potentially compromise your system. Proper sanitizing and checking of user input is essential to prevent this vulnerability.

### Step 1: Sanitize User Inputs
A common example of command injection is through user inputs being placed directly into commands. We need to scrub any user inputs to ensure that they do not contain any malicious input. 

```python
import shlex

def sanitize(user_input):
    return shlex.quote(user_input)
```
In this Python code, the `shlex.quote()` function makes sure that the user input is properly escaped, so any malicious input is rendered harmless.

### Step 2: Limit Use of exec() Functions

In languages like JavaScript and Python, the `exec()` function or similar functions can execute arbitrary command strings. Limiting the use of such functions can significantly reduce the risk of command injection.

For example, if you are using Node.js:

```javascript
// Avoid this
const child = exec('ls ' + user_input);

// Do this instead
const child = execFile('ls', [user_input]);
```
Here, `execFile()` is safer than `exec()` as it doesn't spawn a shell by default.

### Step 3: Use Safer APIs

Many languages have safer alternatives to the exec-type commands. These safer alternatives allow for more controlled execution of commands and can limit the potential for dangerous command injections.

For example, in Python, use subprocess.run() instead of os.system():

```python
import subprocess

# Avoid this
os.system('ls ' + user_input)

# Do this instead
subprocess.run(['ls', user_input])
```
In this Python code, the `subprocess.run()` function is much safer than `os.system()`, making it harder for command injection to occur.
