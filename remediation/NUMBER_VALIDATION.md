# Remediation for NUMBER_VALIDATION

## Remediation Steps for Number Validation

**Number validation** is crucial in ensuring the data received is both valid and secure. Without proper number validation, the security and stability of an application can be compromised because it leaves an opportunity for injection attacks, incorrect data processing, or crashes due to unhandled exceptions.

### Step 1: Add Number Validation Check

In this step, make sure input provided is a valid number before processing it. Here's an example in JavaScript using the isNaN() function to check if the input provided is a number:

```javascript
function validateInput(input) {
    if (isNaN(input)) {
        throw new Error("Invalid input");
    } 
    // proceed with processing of valid number input
}
```

### Step 2: Set a Range

Set a valid range of numbers to accept. There may be cases where negative numbers or decimals are inappropriate. By defining a range you can also protect against overflow attacks.

Here’s an example in Python:

```python
def validate_range(input):
  if input < 0 or input > 100:
    raise ValueError("Input must be between 0 and 100")
  # The input is within the range, proceed with the rest of the code
```

### Step 3: Regular Expression Validation

Regular expressions can be used for more complex validation, such as ensuring input only consists of digits. Regex validation can be implemented in nearly any language.

Here’s an example in Java:

```java
public boolean validateDigits(String input) {
    Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile("\\D");
    Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher(input);
    if (matcher.find()) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Input must only contain digits");
    }
    //Input validated, proceed with the code
}
```

### Step 4: Validate on Client Side and Server Side

For web applications, validation should occur on the client side (to provide immediate feedback to the user) and on the server side (for ensuring the data integrity on the backend). 

Remember: any validation on the client side can be bypassed easily, always validate on server side.

Please note these steps should be adjusted to fit the needs of your specific application and environment.
