## Remediation Steps for Boolean-based SQL Injection with XSS and POST Method APIs

Boolean-based SQL injection is a technique that relies on sending an SQL query to the database which forces the application to return a different result depending on whether the query returns a TRUE or FALSE result. 

To compound the problem if there is also an XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) issue with the POST method APIs, it could lead to severe breaches. With these vulnerabilities, attackers may run arbitrary JavaScript in users' browsers or modify the page content.

### Step 1: Use Parameterized SQL Queries

Parameterized queries help prevent SQL injection attacks since parameters are automatically escaped by your web framework. SQL parameters are values that are added to an SQL query at execution time, in a controlled manner.

```java
// Java PreparedStatement Example
String selectSQL = "SELECT USER_ID FROM USERS WHERE USER_EMAIL = ?";
PreparedStatement preparedStatement = dbConnection.prepareStatement(selectSQL);
preparedStatement.setString(1, userEmail);
```

### Step 2: Enable Content Security Policy (CSP)

Content Security Policy (CSP) can prevent or mitigate the impact of XSS attacks.

```java
// Java servlet example
response.setHeader("Content-Security-Policy", "default-src 'self'");
```

### Step 3: Validate, Sanitize POST Data
Validation (such as type, format, length, range) and sanitization (safe functions, escaping) of input data can help to prevent SQL injections and XSS attacks.

```java
// Python Flask example
from flask_wtf import FlaskForm
from wtforms import StringField, SubmitField
from wtforms.validators import DataRequired, Email, Length

class RegistrationForm(FlaskForm):
    email = StringField('Email', validators=[DataRequired(), Email()])
    submit = SubmitField('Register')
```
