## Remediation Steps for Error Based SQL Injection

Error Based SQL Injection is a serious security issue in the context of databases, specifically Oracle in this case. An attacker may manipulate SQL queries via input parameters to force the database to throw a detailed error message. These error messages can contain information about the structure of the database or fragments of data which the attacker can then utilize.

### Step 1: Use Parameterized Queries

Parameterized queries ensure that parameters (user supplied input) are always treated as literal values, not part of the SQL command itself. This blocks most SQL injection attempts.

Below is an example using Python's SQLite3 library, but this practice is applicable to any language with SQL capabilities.

```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to your database
con = sqlite3.connect('my_database.db')

# Create a cursor object
cur = con.cursor()

# NEVER do something like this
# user_supplied_value = "'DROP TABLE Students; --"
# unsafe_query = f"SELECT * FROM Students WHERE name = {user_supplied_value}"
# Instead, do this:

user_supplied_value = 'John Doe'  # assume this is supplied by a user
safe_query = "SELECT * FROM Students WHERE name = ?"
cur.execute(safe_query, (user_supplied_value,))

# Fetch and print the results normally
rows = cur.fetchall()
for row in rows:
    print(row)

cur.close()
con.close()
```

### Step 2: Implement a Database Firewall 

A database firewall can serve as an additional security layer in intercepting and inspecting SQL queries from the application to the database. Rogue queries indicative of a SQL injection attack can be detected and blocked.

### Step 3: Regular Audit and Update

Ensure that your applications and systems are regularly audited for vulnerabilities and updated when new patches or versions become available.

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
```

Please note that these steps will mitigate most common SQL Injection attacks, but they may not cover all possible vulnerabilities. Further security practices like Least Privilege Principle and securing the database server should also be implemented.
