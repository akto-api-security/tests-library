# Remediation for GITLAB_GRAPHQL_USER_ENUM

## Remediation Steps for GitLab GraphQL API User Enumeration

GitLab GraphQL API User Enumeration can be a serious security issue. If not properly protected, related endpoints can provide attackers with unauthorized ways to enumerate user data, compromising the privacy of users.

### Step 1: Using Rate Limiting 
You should consider the use of rate limiting or throttling for GraphQL queries. This method can reduce the likelihood of malicious attackers executing massive queries.

#### Example with Node.js and Express:

```javascript
const rateLimit = require("express-rate-limit");

const apiLimiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15*60*1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 100
});

app.use("/graphql", apiLimiter);
```

### Step 2: Cascading Permissions
You should employ cascading data permission measures such that each record returns data only if a user requesting the data has the necessary permissions.

#### Example using graphql-shield:

```javascript
const { shield, allow, deny, and, or, not } = require('graphql-shield')

const permissions = shield({
  Query: {
    users: deny, // Only specific users can access this data 
  },
})

const server = new GraphQLServer({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
  middlewares: [permissions],
})
```

### Step 3: Regular Audit and Update
Always monitor and audit the use of your GraphQL API. Ensure your security measures are up-to-date with the latest best practices. 

Please make sure to adapt examples to your own tech stack, the principle stays similar across languages.
