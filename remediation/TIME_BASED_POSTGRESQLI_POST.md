# Remediation for TIME_BASED_POSTGRESQLI_POST

## Remediation Steps for Time-based SQL Injection in PostgreSQL DB for POST method APIs

Time-based SQL injection is a serious security issue where an attacker manipulates SQL queries via input data. Thus, an attacker can take advantage of delays in database responses to retrieve data. Unsecured APIs could be exploited to execute this kind of attacks.

### Step 1: Use Prepared Statements
Using prepared statements is extremely effective against SQL Injection attacks because placeholders are used instead of directly inserting user input into the SQL String.
Below is an example in Python using psycopg2:

```python
import psycopg2
conn = psycopg2.connect(database="mydb", user="myuser", password="mypassword")
cur = conn.cursor()
cur.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = %s and password = %s", ('myuser', 'mypassword'))
```
This way, the parameters that the user can control are sent to the database separately and are not a part of the SQL query itself, rendering SQL injection ineffective.

### Step 2: Use a Website Application Firewall (WAF)

An extra layer of protection can often discover patterns of SQL Injection and prevent those malicious requests from ever reaching your application. Many WAF solutions are available that could be installed and operated.

### Step 3: Regular Audit and Update
Make sure your system and PostgreSQL database are up-to-date. New vulnerabilities are discovered daily, and keeping your software up-to-date is an easy way to protect your system against known vulnerabilities. 

### Step 4: Least Privilege Principle

Apply database users with only enough privileges needed for your application to work in order to prevent an attacker from performing admin level tasks on your database. 

### Step 5: Input Validation

Always validate user input and limit the usage of special characters as much as possible. If your application doesn't need certain special characters, simply block them with validation rules.

### Step 6: Error Handling

Avoid showing database error details to your users. This information could potentially be useful to an attacker, giving them hints about your database structure or the nature of the vulnerability they are trying to exploit.
