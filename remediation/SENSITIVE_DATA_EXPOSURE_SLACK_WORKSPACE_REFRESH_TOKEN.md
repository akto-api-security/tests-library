## Remediation Steps for Sensitive Data Exposure of Slack Workspace Refresh Token
Sensitive data exposure is a serious security issue where unauthorized individuals may acquire access to critical data, in this case your Slack Workspace Refresh Token. Follow these steps to rectify the issue.

### Step 1: Invalidate the Current Refresh Token
You have to invalidate the exposed token immediately in order to prevent any misuse.
Using the Slack API in Python:

```python
import requests

token = "xoxb-Your_Old_Token" 
response = requests.post('https://slack.com/api/auth.revoke', {'token': token})

if response.status_code == 200 and response.json()['ok']:
    print("Token has been successfully invalidated.")
else:
    print("Failed to invalidate token!")
```
This will make your old token invalid.

### Step 2: Generate a new Slack Workspace Refresh Token

You can generate a new token with slack on website or by using Slack API.

```python
import requests

client_id = 'your_client_id'  # client id for your slack app
client_secret = 'your_client_secret'  # client secret for your slack app
code = 'authorization_code'  # the code you received after user install your slack app

response = requests.get('https://slack.com/api/oauth.access', 
                        {'client_id': client_id,
                         'client_secret': client_secret,
                         'code': code})

if response.status_code == 200 and response.json()['ok']:
    new_token = response.json()['access_token']
    print("New token is: ", new_token)
else:
    print("Failed to get new token!")
```

### Step 3: Secure Storage of New Token
Remember to securely store your refresh token, it should not be stored as a string in your source code, especially if it is posted publicly.
