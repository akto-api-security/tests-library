# Remediation for PROMPT_LEAK_INJECTION

## Remediation Steps for Prompt Leak Injection Test on LLMs

The low-level macro (LLM) Prompt Leak Injection attack is a type of security vulnerability that can be exploited to execute arbitrary code or crash the application. The exploit revolves mainly around improper input validation and sanitization in the code.

### Step 1: Validate and Sanitize Input

Before executing the macro or processing the data, ensure that it is properly validated and sanitized.

```python
import re

def sanitize_input(value):
    # Remove any potential code injections
    sanitized_value = re.sub('[^a-zA-Z0-9 \n\.]', '', value)
    return sanitized_value
```

### Step 2: Limit Macro Access

Ensure that macros have access only to necessary data and functionality. Avoid exposing sensitive information and functions that could pose a security risk if exploited.

### Step 3: Implement Error Handling

Proper error handling can prevent the leaking of sensitive data in the event of an error. Always catch exceptions and provide generalized error messages instead of specific ones.

```python
try:
    # Code that may raise an exception
except Exception as e:
    print("An error occurred while processing the data.")
```
