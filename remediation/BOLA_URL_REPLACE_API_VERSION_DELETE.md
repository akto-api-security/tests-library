# Remediation for BOLA_URL_REPLACE_API_VERSION_DELETE

## Remediation Steps for Exploiting BOLA by Replacing URL Path with API Version IDs

Exploiting BOLA (Broken Object Level Authorization) by replacing URL path with API Version IDs for unauthorized access for DELETE based APIs is a concerning security issue. Attackers may manipulate the API calls to unauthorizedly delete resources.

### Step 1: Validate User Permission
Before processing the DELETE request, validate the user's permissions to determine if they have the appropriate rights to perform the delete operation.

```java
if(user.hasPermission("CAN_DELETE")){
    processDeleteRequest();
}else{
    throw new AuthorizationException("User does not have the required permission");
}
```

### Step 2: Validate the Object Ownership
Also, ensure that the user owns or has been granted permission to modify the resources he/she is attempting to delete.

```java
if(user.isOwner(object) || user.hasPermission(object, "CAN_DELETE")){
    processDeleteRequest(object);
}else{
    throw new AuthorizationException("User does not own the resource or have the required permission");
}
```

### Step 3: Object Binding
Use techniques like Direct Object Reference Maps or Ownership-Based Object References which maps the internal IDs of the application to IDs which are controlled by and have a meaning to the user. Thus effectively mitigating the risk of BOLA APIs.

```java
DirectObjectReferenceMap map = new DirectObjectReferenceMap(user);
int userControlledId = map.getInternalId(urlParamId);
processDeleteRequest(userControlledId);
```

### Step 4: Regularly Review Logs
It is also highly recommended to regularly review security and system logs for irregular patterns or security anomalies, and keep the system up-to-date and patched.

```bash
tail -f /var/log/syslog
```
