## Remediation Steps for Golang expvar Information Disclosure
The Golang 'expvar' package can release environment sensitive data. If you're not careful, attackers can exploit this vulnerability to retrieve information about your application that was supposed to be secret. This can lead to compromising the security of your applications.

### Step 1: Understanding the problem
First, it's important to understand that 'expvar' provides a standardized interface to public variables, such as operation counters in servers. It uses HTTP to report these statistics. This means any values you havenâ€™t explicitly published will not be emitted. It's essential to have controls to avoid exposing sensitive information via this package.

### Step 2: Carefully manage the data you publish
When publishing data with 'expvar', you should ensure that you're not publishing sensitive information like passwords.

```golang
var password string = "secretPassword"
expvar.Publish("password", expvar.Func(func() interface{} {
   // Never return sensitive data here. // In this case, do not return password.
   return nil
}))
```
In the example above, although a password is published, the function returns nil and so the password will not get exposed.

### Step 3: Use other packages for sensitive information
If you have to handle sensitive values, consider using different packages that are specifically designed for secure storage and handling, such as golang.org/x/crypto/nacl/secretbox.

```golang
package main

import (
	"crypto/rand"
	"fmt"
	"io"

	"golang.org/x/crypto/nacl/secretbox"
)

func main() {
	key := [32]byte{}
	if _, err := io.ReadFull(rand.Reader, key[:]); err != nil {
		fmt.Println("error:", err)
		return
	}

	message := "my secret message"
	var nonce [24]byte
	if _, err := io.ReadFull(rand.Reader, nonce[:]); err != nil {
		fmt.Println("error:", err)
		return
	}

	out := secretbox.Seal(nonce[:], []byte(message), &nonce, &key)
	fmt.Printf("%x\n", out)
}
```
The 'secretbox' package ensures data is encrypted and decrypted securely.
