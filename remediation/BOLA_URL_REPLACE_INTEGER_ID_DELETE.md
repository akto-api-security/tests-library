# Remediation for BOLA_URL_REPLACE_INTEGER_ID_DELETE

## Remediation Steps for Exploiting BOLA (Broken Object Level Authorization) with DELETE based APIs Vulnerability

Broken Object Level Authorization exploits occur when APIs expose endpoints that handle object identifiers, creating a wide attack surface Level Access Control issue. In this case, by replacing the URL path with Integer IDs for unauthorized access. Here are the general remediation steps:

### Step 1: Implement Object Level Authorization

The proper way to fix and prevent BOLA/AOLA vulnerabilities is to ensure that the application's API uses a proper object level authorization method. It should check if the user is authorized to perform the requested action on every individual API endpoint. 

```python
def isAuthorized(user, objectId):
    # implement your authorization logic
    pass
```

### Step 2: Validate User Rights

Make sure that API endpoints that can delete objects should first validate that the user has the right to delete the object. 

```python
def deleteObject(user, objectId):
    if isAuthorized(user, objectId):
      # proceed with deleting the object
    else:
      # raise an unauthorized action exception
    pass
```

### Step 3: Use UUID Instead of Sequential IDs

Using UUIDs instead of sequential IDs for record identifiers makes it more difficult for attackers to guess other valid IDs.

```python
import uuid
objectId = uuid.uuid4() # Generate a new universally unique identifier (UUID)
```
