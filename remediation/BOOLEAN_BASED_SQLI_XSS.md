# Remediation for BOOLEAN_BASED_SQLI_XSS

## Remediation Steps for Boolean Based SQL Injection Test with XSS

Boolean based SQL injection combined with Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a serious security concern. If a system is vulnerable to Boolean based SQL injection, unauthorized users might execute arbitrary SQL commands. XSS may allow malicious scripts to be injected into the web pages viewed by other users.

### Step 1: Parameterized Queries
Using parameterized queries is an excellent way to prevent SQL injection attacks, you can use this in several popular languages such as Java, C#, PHP and more.

Here is an example in Java:

```java
String selectSQL = "SELECT user_id FROM users WHERE username = ? ";
PreparedStatement preparedStatement = dbConnection.prepareStatement(selectSQL);
preparedStatement.setString(1, username);
ResultSet rs = preparedStatement.executeQuery(selectSQL);
```

### Step 2: Input Validation
XSS attacks can be prevented by validating, sanitizing and escaping user inputs.
Here is an example using PHP:

```php
$user_input = "<script>malicious script</script>";
$sanitized_user_input = filter_var($user_input, FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING);
```

### Step 3: Content Security Policy (CSP)
Additionally, maintaining an effective Content Security Policy (CSP) can prevent XSS attacks by controlling sources from which scripts and other hazardous resources that are allowed to load.

```html
<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" 
content="default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'">
```

### Step 4: Regular Updates and Security Audits
Regularly update all your software, including the programming languages and libraries used, as the latest versions usually include security patches for known vulnerabilities. Implement periodic security audits to detect and remediate vulnerabilities in time. 

This could be done by using security tools or hiring professionals to perform security audits:

```bash
# Example for a security tool: OWASP Zap Scanning
docker run -t owasp/zap2docker-stable zap-baseline.py -t https://www.example.com
```
Finally, consider using WAFs or similar security solutions to add an extra layer of security.
