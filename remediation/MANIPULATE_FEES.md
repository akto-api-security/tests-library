# Remediation for MANIPULATE_FEES

## Remediation Steps for Manipulating Fees or Price in Transactions
Manipulating Fees or Price in Transactions is a severe security issue. Without accurate management of prices and fees, attackers could alter these amounts leading to financial fraud and loss. Solving this issue involves both server-side and client-side securities.

### Step 1: Implement Server-side Validations
Server-side validations are crucial in business transactions. Always validate the transaction amount on the server side with the stored product price.

```python
# Python example using Flask
from flask import request

@app.route('/purchase', methods=['POST'])
def purchase():
    product_id = request.form.get('product_id')
    provided_price = request.form.get('price')  # price provided by the client
    actual_price = get_price_from_db(product_id)  # function to retrieve the stored price from database

    if actual_price != provided_price:
        return "Error: Price does not match", 400

    # rest of the processing
```

### Step 2: Use HTTPS for Transactions
Ensure to use HTTPS for communication during transactions. By using HTTPS, you can prevent attackers from inspecting or modifying the transmitted data.


### Step 3: Encryption of sensitive data
Ensure that the price details are encrypted while being stored and decrypted only when necessary. This would help against the attacks if the attacker gain access to your database.

```python
# python example using Fernet symmetric encryption
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet

# Generate a key and instantiate a Fernet instance
key = Fernet.generate_key()
cipher_suite = Fernet(key)

# Encrypt the data
cipher_text = cipher_suite.encrypt(b"A really secret message.")
```
