## Remediation Steps for GraphQL Development Console Exposure

Exposure of GraphQL Development Console can lead to serious security issues. Without proper security measures in place, attackers may gain unauthorized access to sensitive data.

### Step 1: Disable Graphql Playground/Development Console in Production Environment
In order to disable the Playground when your application is running in production, you have to manually set the `playground` option to `false` in Apollo Server. 


```javascript
const { ApolloServer, gql } = require('apollo-server');
const typeDefs = gql`
  type Query {
    helloWorld: String
  }
`;
const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    helloWorld: () => 'Hello, world!'
  }
};
const server = new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
  introspection: false,
  playground: false,
});
```
This will ensure that your graphical interactive in-browser GraphQL IDE will not be running on the production instance of your app, thereby reducing exposure.

### Step 2: Positive Security Model
Implement a positive security model wherein only those actions that are expressly granted to the user are permitted, and everything else is denied.

Here's an example of access checking in GraphQL. `context` is an object available in every resolver that can store information about the current request. A `user` field can be included with information about the current user, and used to determine whether they have the permission to return a requested field.  

```javascript
const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    secret: (parent, args, context) => {
      if (!context.user) {
        throw new Error("You are not authenticated!");
      }
      return "Super Secret Content"
    }
  }
}
```
