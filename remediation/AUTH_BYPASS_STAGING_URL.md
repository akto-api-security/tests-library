## Remediation Steps for Authentication Bypass by hitting Staging URLs for Login endpoints
Authentication Bypass by hitting staging URLs for Login endpoints is a serious security vulnerability that allows unauthorized parties to gain access to the system bypassing the login process.

### Step 1: Segregate Network
Ensure that your staging and production environments are completely isolated from each other. This can be accomplished by setting up different subnets for the environments.

```bash
# Use "ip" command to interact with routing, network devices, interfaces and tunnels
ip link set dev eth0 up
ip addr add 192.168.2.1/24 brd + dev eth0
```

### Step 2: Set up Firewalls
Establish a firewall for each environment with specific rules to limit access strictly. This includes blocking all external requests coming to staging URLs.

```bash
# Use "iptables" to control incoming and outgoing network traffic
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -s 192.168.1.0/24 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j DROP
iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -d 192.168.2.0/24 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j DROP
```

### Step 3: Implement Authentication on Staging
Implement and enforce strong authentication mechanisms on your staging URLs just like production URLs. This can be achieved by adding authentication middleware on the staging endpoints.

```python
# Python Flask example
from flask import Flask, request, Response
from flask_httpauth import HTTPBasicAuth
auth = HTTPBasicAuth()

users = {
    "admin": "super_secret_password",
}

@auth.get_password
def get_pw(username):
    if username in users:
        return users.get(username)
    return None

@app.route('/secret-endpoint')
@auth.login_required
def secret_endpoint():
    return {'Secret': 'Endpoint'}
```
