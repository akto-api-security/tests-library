# Remediation for COMMAND_INJECTION_WITH_REDIRECTION_AND_VAR_MANIPULATION

## Remediation Steps for Command Injection using Redirection and Variable Manipulation
Command injection is a serious security flaw which can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the host operating system via a vulnerable application. Security misconfigurations or poorly designed applications can lead to this issue. Following is an example of how to remediate this vulnerability:

### Step 1: Use of Safe APIs
Wherever possible, prefer the usage of safe APIs which avoid shell command execution.
```py
# Python
import subprocess
subprocess.run(["ls", "-l"])
```
```java
// Java
Runtime.getRuntime().exec(new String[] {"ls", "-l"});
```

### Step 2: Input Validation
Always validate user input to ensure it does not contain special characters that could allow for command injection.
```java
// Java
if (userInput.matches("[0-9a-zA-Z]*")) {
    /* safe to use userInput */
} else {
    /* potentially dangerous input */
}
```
### Step 3: Use of Bind Variables
In SQL or similar structured queries, utilize bind variables to remove the potential for injection.
```java
// Java with JDBC
PreparedStatement statement = connection.prepareStatement("SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = ?");
statement.setString(1, userInput);
ResultSet resultSet = statement.executeQuery();
```

### Step 4: Escaping Mechanism
Use appropriate context-dependent escaping mechanism when running shell commands.
```py
# Python
from shlex import quote
command = "ls -l " + quote(userInput)
os.system(command)
```

### Step 5: Principle of Least Privilege
Run applications with the least privileges necessary in order to reduce the potential impact.
```bash
# Adding a non-root user in Dockerfile for Docker containers
RUN adduser --disabled-password --gecos '' mynonrootuser
USER mynonrootuser
```
