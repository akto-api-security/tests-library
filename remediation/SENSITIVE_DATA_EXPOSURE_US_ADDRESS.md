# Remediation for SENSITIVE_DATA_EXPOSURE_US_ADDRESS

## Remediation Steps for Sensitive Data Exposure: US Address
Sensitive data exposure is a serious security concern. This can include data such as US addresses, which can be utilized inappropriately if exposed.  

### Step 1: Encrypt Sensitive Data 
Sensitive data like US addresses should always be stored in an encrypted format, using up-to-date and strong cryptographic methods. Here is an example in Python using the cryptography library which implements Fernet symmetric encryption.

```python
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet
# Generate a key
key = Fernet.generate_key()
cipher_suite = Fernet(key)
# Store this key securely

# Given some data
data = "123 Main St, Anytown, USA"
data = data.encode()

# Encrypt the data
cipher_text = cipher_suite.encrypt(data)

# At this point, cipher_text can be safely stored
```

### Step 2: Data Minimization
Ensure that you only store what you absolutely need. If there is no business need for retaining sensitive data, it is best not to record it. 

### Step 3: Implement Access Controls
Only authorized individuals should have access to sensitive data. Make sure that data is only accessible by people who have authentication and permission to access it.

### Step 4: Secure Transmissions 
When data is transmitted, it should always be sent over a secured channel. Here is an example of an HTTPS request in Python.

```python
import requests

url = "https://example.com"
params = {
    "address": cipher_text
}

response = requests.post(url, data=params, verify=True)
```

### Step 5: Regular Audit
Conduct regular audits of your data handling practices to ensure that you are in compliance with all relevant standards and laws, as well as any internal policies. 

Remember, the most secure data is the data you never store! Anything that you do store needs to be properly secured, and unnecessary data should be safely discarded.
