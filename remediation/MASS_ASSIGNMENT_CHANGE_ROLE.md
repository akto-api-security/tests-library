# Remediation for MASS_ASSIGNMENT_CHANGE_ROLE

## Remediation Steps for Mass Assignment leading to modification of role
Mass Assignment is a security issue that can lead to undesired modifications of data such as user roles. An attacker could potentially modify the role of a user to gain greater access rights if mass assignment is not properly handled within your applications.

### Step 1: Whitelisting Approach
Only permit the passing of fields that are required to create or update a record. This is the best and most thorough defense against Mass Assignment.

Here is a Ruby on Rails example using Strong Parameters:

```ruby
class UsersController < ApplicationController
  def user_params
    params.require(:user).permit(:name, :email)
  end
end
```

Here is a Python Flask example:
```python
from flask import request

@app.route('/user', methods=['POST'])
def create_user():
    user = User(email=request.form['email'], username=request.form['username'])
    db.session.add(user)
    db.session.commit()
```

### Step 2: Blacklisting Approach
If the whitelisting approach is not feasible, certain parameters should at least be blacklisted to ensure they're not processed for mass assignment during creation or updating of a record.

Here is a Ruby on Rails example using Strong Parameters:

```ruby
class UsersController < ApplicationController
  def user_params
    params[:user].delete(:admin)
    params.require(:user).permit!
  end
end
```

Please note that blacklisting is generally riskier than whitelisting, as new parameters could be added in the future that also need to be blacklisted.

### Step 3: Regular Code Reviews
It's essential to have regular code reviews and audits to ensure that these remedies are constantly applied.

Preventing mass assignment vulnerabilities largely involves being aware of how your chosen programming language/framework handles this. As such, this must be a key part of any secure code training for your teams. Regular reviews help in keeping everyone aligned with secure coding practices and can help in identifying potential vulnerabilities early in the development process.
