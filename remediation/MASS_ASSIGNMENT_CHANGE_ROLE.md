## Remediation Steps for Mass Assignment leading to modification of role
Mass Assignment is a security issue that can lead to undesired modifications of data such as user roles. An attacker could potentially modify the role of a user to gain greater access rights if mass assignment is not properly handled within your applications.

### Step 1: Whitelisting Approach
Only permit the passing of fields that are required to create or update a record. This is the best and most thorough defense against Mass Assignment.

Here is a Ruby on Rails example using Strong Parameters:

```ruby
class UsersController < ApplicationController
  def user_params
    params.require(:user).permit(:name, :email)
  end
end
```

Here is a Python Flask example:
```python
from flask import request

@app.route('/user', methods=['POST'])
def create_user():
    user = User(email=request.form['email'], username=request.form['username'])
    db.session.add(user)
    db.session.commit()
```

### Step 2: Blacklisting Approach
If the whitelisting approach is not feasible, certain parameters should at least be blacklisted to ensure they're not processed for mass assignment during creation or updating of a record.

Here is a Ruby on Rails example using Strong Parameters:

```ruby
class UsersController < ApplicationController
  def user_params
    params[:user].delete(:admin)
    params.require(:user).permit!
  end
end
```

Please note that blacklisting is generally riskier than whitelisting, as new parameters could be added in the future that also need to be blacklisted.
