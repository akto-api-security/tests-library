## Remediation Steps for Second Order SQL Injection Test with XSS

Second Order SQL Injection with XSS is a severe security issue where malicious SQL statements are stored and later executed. Exploits can harm data integrity and lead to unauthorized access. 

### Step 1: Input Validation

Validate inputs and restrict special characters. One standard way is to use Regular Expressions in your code:

```python
import re

def validate_input(user_input): 
    pattern = re.compile("^[A-Za-z0-9]*$")
    return bool(pattern.match(user_input))
```

### Step 2: Prepared Statements (Parameterized queries)

Prepared statements ensure your code separates SQL code from data, reducing the risk of SQL Injection:

```java
String sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ?";
PreparedStatement statement = connection.prepareStatement(sql);
statement.setString(1, email);
ResultSet results = statement.executeQuery();
```

### Step 3: Output Encoding 

Protect your application from reflective XSS attacks by ensuring that all dynamic content has appropriate escaping. A typical way is to use `htmlspecialchars()` in PHP:

```php
echo htmlspecialchars($user_input, ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8');
```

### Step 4: Use Web Application Firewall (WAF)

WAFs can prevent XSS attacks by detecting and blocking potential threats before reaching your web application.

### Step 5: Content Security Policy

Add a Content Security Policy (CSP) header to your responses. This controls the sources from which scripts can be loaded, thus, preventing XSS attacks.

```python
response['Content-Security-Policy'] = "default-src 'self'"
```
