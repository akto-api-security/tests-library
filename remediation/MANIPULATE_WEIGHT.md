# Remediation for MANIPULATE_WEIGHT

## Remediation Steps for Manipulating Weight Input Parameters in Shipping or Logistic Related APIs

Manipulating weight input parameters is a serious security issue that may lead to financial losses, system vulnerabilities, and unauthorized data access. This issue occurs when users are able to tamper with weight input parameters that affect shipping costs or logistical considerations.

### Step 1: User Input Validation
Ensure that the user's input is tightly constrained and matches expectations. This can be achieved by applying check constraints at the database layer and also sanitizing input at code level.

The following Java snippet provides an example of checking if the input is valid:

```java
public boolean isValidWeight(String weight) {
    try {
        float weightFloat = Float.parseFloat(weight);
        if (weightFloat < 0 || weightFloat > 1000) {
            throw new NumberFormatException();
        }
        return true;
    } catch (NumberFormatException e) {
        return false;
    }
}
```

### Step 2: Parameterize API Calls
Use prepared statements or parameterized queries when constructing API calls In parameterized queries, placeholders are used instead of directly writing the values. This neutralizes the risk of manipulating parameters.

Python script with SQLAlchemy:

```python
from sqlalchemy import text

weight_input = input("Enter the weight: ") # Get user input
query = text("SELECT * FROM logistics WHERE weight=:weight")
result = conn.execute(query, weight=weight_input)
```

### Step 3: Implement Server-Side Validation
Even if the client-side validation is bypassed, the server-side validation acts as a security measure to protect against malicious input. 

```java
@PostMapping("logistics")
public ResponseEntity<Object> handleRequest(@RequestBody LogisticsRequest request) {
   if (!isValidWeight(request.getWeight())) {
        return ResponseEntity.badRequest().body("Invalid weight!");
    }
   ...
}
```
