## Remediation Steps for SSRF Exposing Localhost Details
Sensitive localhost details being exposed via replacing Image param with redirection due to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) is a serious security issue. Without proper checks, an attacker might be able to perform operations that they are not authorized to perform, like accessing local/internal resources which are otherwise not reachable from outside.

### Step 1: Validate User Input
Ensure that all user input is validated before the application processes it. This may include ensuring URLs are safe and no redirection to localhost or RFC 1918 IP addresses are possible. A simple code implementation in Python could be:

```python
import ipaddress
import socket
from urllib.parse import urlparse

def is_valid_url(url):
    hostname = urlparse(url).hostname
    ip_address = socket.gethostbyname(hostname)
    if ipaddress.ip_address(ip_address).is_private:
        return False
    return True
```

### Step 2: Using a Web Application Firewall (WAF)
WAF can detect and block SSRF attacks by filtering malicious requests. It's recommended to use a commercial product or a trustworthy open-source project.

### Step 3: Use Network Segregation
Ensure that your server can only make outbound connections to necessary services and ports.
