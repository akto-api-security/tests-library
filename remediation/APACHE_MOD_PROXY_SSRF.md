# Remediation for APACHE_MOD_PROXY_SSRF

## Remediation Steps for Apache Mod_Proxy Server-Side Request Forgery
Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in Apache Mod_Proxy is a security vulnerability that could potentially allow an attacker to make requests to internal resources behind the firewall.

### Step 1: Update Apache Server
The first step is to update your Apache server to the latest version that contains a patch for this vulnerability.
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade apache2
```
### Step 2: Configure Apache Mod_Proxy
Prohibit all proxy requests by default and explicitly allow only trusted sources.
```bash
<Proxy "*">
  Order Deny,Allow
  Deny from all
  # Then allow only from trusted sources
  Allow from 192.0.2.0/24
</Proxy>
```
Replace `192.0.2.0/24` with the correct IP range.

### Step 3: Limit Mod_Proxy to Specific URLs
It's recommended to limit Mod_Proxy to proxy for specific URLs to further secure the application. This can be achieved by defining those specific URLs in configuration.
```apache
<Proxy http://trusted.example.com/*>
  Order deny,allow
  Allow from all
</Proxy>
```
Replace `http://trusted.example.com/*` with the appropriate URL.

### Step 4: Regularly Monitor and Audit
Set up regular monitoring and auditing of proxies and requests to detect any unusual activities.
```bash
# Enable Apache's mod_status for real-time data
a2enmod mod_status
# Add configuration for mod_status under your VirtualHost
<VirtualHost *:80>
  ExtendedStatus On
  <Location /server-status>
    SetHandler server-status
    Order Deny,Allow
    Deny from all
    Allow from 127.0.0.1
  </Location>
</VirtualHost>
```
### Step 5: Restart Apache Server
Finally, restart Apache server to apply all changes.
```bash
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```
