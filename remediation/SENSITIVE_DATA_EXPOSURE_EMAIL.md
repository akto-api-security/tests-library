# Remediation for SENSITIVE_DATA_EXPOSURE_EMAIL

## Remediation Steps for Sensitive Data Exposure for EMAIL

Sensitive data exposure for EMAIL occurs when a system does not adequately protect sensitive information such as email addresses. Attackers can gain unauthorized access to these email addresses and use them for malicious purposes.

### Step 1: Encrypt email addresses
The first step in remedying sensitive data exposure is to encrypt email addresses. Encryption transforms the original representation of the information, known as plaintext, into an alternative form known as ciphertext. 

For example, if we assume data is stored in a SQL Server database, we can use built-in SQL encryption:

```sql
ALTER TABLE Users
ADD EmailEncrypted varbinary(MAX);
GO

UPDATE Users
SET EmailEncrypted = EncryptByPassPhrase('EncryptionKey', Email);
GO

ALTER TABLE Users
DROP COLUMN Email;
GO
```
### Step 2: Use HTTPS for all traffic
Next, ensure that HTTPS is used for all traffic, not just for sensitive communication. HTTPS provides an extra layer of security by utilizing SSL/TLS to provide encrypted communication and secure identification of a network server.

For example, in Python Flask app, you can enforce HTTPS as follows:

```python
from flask import Flask
from flask_talisman import Talisman

app = Flask(__name__)
Talisman(app)
```

### Step 3: Display generic error messages
It's important not to reveal too much information in error messages. For example, rather than saying 'Email already exists', a better response might be 'The data you entered already exists'.

```javascript
app.post('/api/users', function (req, res) {
  User.create(req.body, function (err) {
    if (err) {
      return res.status(500).send('The data you entered already exists');
    }
    res.status(200).send('User created successfully');
  });
});
```

### Step 4: Regularly audit databases and user roles
Regularly auditing your databases for any unprotected sensitive data and ensuring that appropriate user roles permissions are in place is a security best practice. Depending upon the database you're using, there may be built-in auditing features that you can take advantage of.
