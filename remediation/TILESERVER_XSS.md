## Remediation Steps for Tileserver API XSS

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities on a Tileserver API could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into websites viewed by other users. These scripts are executed by the victim's browser and can be used to bypass access controls, steal sensitive information, etc. 

The key to mitigating XSS vulnerabilities is to sanitize and validate all user inputs on the server side, ensure the API uses proper CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) policy and deliver content with a Content Security Policy (CSP).

### Step 1: Input Sanitization 

Ensure that any input from the user is correctly sanitized. This includes not only form input but also URL parameters. 

```python
from django.core.validators import URLValidator
from django.core.exceptions import ValidationError

val = URLValidator()

tile_url = request.GET.get('url', '')

try:
    val(tile_url)
except ValidationError:
    print("Invalid URL passed")

```

### Step 2: CORS Policy

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) provides mechanisms to enable mutual communication between server and client domain. 

Here is how to set the CORS policy using Express.js:

```javascript
var express = require('express')
var cors = require('cors')
var app = express()

var corsOptions = {
    origin: 'http://example.com',
    optionsSuccessStatus: 200 
}

app.get('/api/tile', cors(corsOptions), function (req, res) {
    res.json({msg: 'This is CORS-enabled for only example.com.'})
});

app.listen(80, function () {
    console.log('CORS-enabled web server listening on port 80')
});
```

### Step 3: Content Security Policy (CSP)

CSP provides another layer of security. By setting a policy on the server, the browser will only load resources from the whitelisted URIâ€™s. 

In Node.js with Express, use Helmet.js to set up the CSP.

```javascript
const express = require('express')
const helmet = require('helmet')

const app = express()

app.use(helmet.contentSecurityPolicy({
  directives: {
    defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
    scriptSrc: ["'self'", "https://trusted.cdn.com/js"]
  }
}))

# Then start the server
app.listen(3000)
```
