# Remediation for PUPPETEER_RENDERER_LFI

## Remediation Steps for Puppeteer Renderer Directory Traversal Test

A Puppeteer Renderer Directory Traversal Test issue happens when an attacker can access files and directories that are stored outside the webroot folder. By manipulating variables that reference files with “dot-dot-slash (../)” sequences and its variations, it is possible to access arbitrary files and directories stored on the file system.

### Step 1: Validate File Paths
Prevent directory traversal attacks by rejecting file paths with "..", "~" or ":" with proper validation. This can be accomplished using regular expressions.

```javascript
const path = require('path');
const fs = require('fs');

function safePath(userInput) {
    userInput = path.normalize(userInput);
    if (userInput.includes("..") || userInput.includes("~") || userInput.includes(":")) {
        return false;
    }
    return userInput;
}

let userPath = safePath(req.body.path);
if (userPath) {
    fs.readFile(userPath, 'utf8' , (err, data) => {
        if (err) {
            console.error(err);
        }
        console.log(data);
    });
}
```
### Step 2: Use a static file server
If you're using Express, a better way to serve files is by using `express.static()` as it handles path safety for you.

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.use('/static', express.static('public'));

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Listening...'))
```
### Step 3: Regular code audits
Use a static code analysis tool to regularly scan your codebase for potential vulnerabilities. This will help you identify if potentially exploitable code has been introduced.

As always, regular updates and maintenance of the system and its dependencies is paramount to maintain the security of the application. Ensure all packages are regularly updated and security practices are followed in your development team.
