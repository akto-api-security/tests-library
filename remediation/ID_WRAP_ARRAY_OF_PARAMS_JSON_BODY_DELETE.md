## Remediation Steps for BOLA: Turning JSON Param into Array of Params for Unauthorized Access (DELETE method APIs)

BOLA or Broken Object Level Authorization can lead to serious security issues wherein attackers can gain unauthorized access to APIs. By manipulating JSON parameters into an array of parameters for DELETE method APIs, they can potentially perform actions they are not entitled to perform. Here are some remediation steps to help mitigate this problem.

### Step 1: Implement Proper Authorization
Make sure each API endpoint that processes user data implements proper authorization. Always verify that the logged-in user has all necessary permissions to perform the action. Here is an example for a Node.JS Express application:

```javascript
app.delete('/api/resource/:resourceId', checkAuth, checkPermission, function (req, res) {
    // deletion logic
});
```

### Step 2: Use UUIDs
Instead of sequential integers, use UUIDs for record identification, making them harder to guess and iterate over.

```javascript
const { v4: uuidv4 } = require('uuid');
let resourceId = uuidv4(); // '1b9d6bcd-bbfd-4b2d-9b5d-ab8dfbbd4bed'
```

### Step 3: Input Data Validation
Ensure the input parameters are correctly validated and sanitized.

```javascript
let resourceId = req.params.resourceId;
if (!uuidValidator.validate(resourceId)) {
    res.status(400).json({error: 'Invalid resource ID.'});
    return;
}
```

### Step 4: Apply Rate Limiting
Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse from a specific user performing too many requests in a short amount of time.

```javascript
const rateLimit = require("express-rate-limit");
 
const apiLimiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 100
});
 
app.use("/api/", apiLimiter);
```
