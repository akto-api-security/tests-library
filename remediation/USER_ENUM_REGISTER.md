# Remediation for USER_ENUM_REGISTER

## Remediation Steps for Broken Authentication Test - Username Enumeration via Registration Endpoint

Broken Authentication is a serious security issue where attackers can exploit weaknesses in the authentication or session management functions (such as exposed accounts, passwords, session IDs) to impersonate other users. Specifically, username enumeration via registration endpoint is one such weakness that can be exploited.

### Step 1: Update Registration Response Messages

The system should not inform the user if the username exists during the registration process. The error message must be generic, irrelevant whether the email exists or not.

```python
# Python/Flask example:
from flask import Flask, request
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/register', methods=['POST'])
def register():
    username = request.form['username']
    password = request.form['password']
    # more code to store user...
    return 'Registration successful or username already in use. Please check your email for confirmation'
```

### Step 2: Use Email for Registration Confirmation

The easiest and most effective way is to send a confirmation email rather than telling the user directly whether their username exists.

```python
# Python example with Flask-Mail:
from flask_mail import Mail, Message
mail = Mail(app)

msg = Message('Registration Confirmation', sender = 'your-email@example.com', recipients = [username])
msg.body = 'Please click the link in this email to confirm your registration.'
mail.send(msg)
```

### Step 3: Implement Account Lockouts

Implement an account lockout policy. After a certain number of failed login attempts, lock the account and inform the user.

```python
# Python example:
@app.route('/login', methods=['POST'])
def login():
    username = request.form['username']
    password = request.form['password']
    # more code...
    if login_attempts >= MAX_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS:
        return 'Account locked. Please check your email for further instructions.'
```

### Step 4: Regular code audit and update

Ensure to regularly update and audit the codebase to avoid and fix any possible vulnerability.

```bash
# Some developers like to use Git for version control.
git add .
git commit -m "Regular code audit and update"
git push origin master
```
