# Remediation for REPLACE_CSRF

## Remediation Steps for CSRF Test with Invalid CSRF Token

CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) is a form of attack which forces an end user to execute unintended actions on a web application in which he/she is authenticated. It becomes a serious issue if the user with elevated privileges gets compromised, leading to significant security breaches. A CSRF attack can be prevented by notable security measures, which include ensuring the use of a valid CSRF token. 


### Step 1: Validate the CSRF Token

Firstly, ensure to validate the CRSF token on every POST request your application receives. Invalid tokens should be immediately flagged and the request should be denied. The following is an example using Express.js middleware in Node.js:

```javascript
app.post('/path', csrfProtection, (req, res) => {
  // action code here
});
```

### Step 2: Generate a New CSRF Token for each Session

Ensure that a new CSRF token is generated each time a new session is initiated. This significantly reduces the ability for an attacker to guess what a valid CSRF token might look like. The following shows an example in Django Python:

```python
def csrf(request):
    token = CSRF_TOKEN
    return render(request, "csrf.html", {"csrf_token": token})
```

### Step 3: Use Anti-CSRF Tokens (Double Submit Cookies Pattern)

Use CSRF tokens in both cookies and HTTP headers. The server should verify if the submitted token in the custom HTTP header matches with the one in the cookie. The below example demonstrates this strategy in Java:

```java
public void doGet(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp) {
  // generate the CSRF token and save it to user's session
  String csrfToken = generateCSRFToken();
  HttpSession session = req.getSession();
  session.setAttribute("CSRFToken", csrfToken);
  
  // also set this token to a cookie
  Cookie cookie = new Cookie("CSRFToken", csrfToken);
  resp.addCookie(cookie);
  ...
}
public void doPost(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp) {
  // check if CSRF token in session and cookie are the same
  HttpSession session = req.getSession();
  String sessionToken = (String) session.getAttribute("CSRFToken");

  Cookie[] cookies = req.getCookies();
  String cookieToken = null;
  for (Cookie c : cookies) {
    if ("CSRFToken".equals(c.getName())) {
      cookieToken = c.getValue();
    }
  }
  
  if (cookieToken != null && cookieToken.equals(sessionToken)) {
    // proceed with the operation
    ...
  } else {
    // CSRF attack! Do not proceed!
    throw new SecurityException("CSRF token mismatch");
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Regular Audits and Updates

It's also worth mentioning in this remediation that you should continually audit and evaluate the security protocols your application takes. Regular updates should be released to fix any existing vulnerabilities.
