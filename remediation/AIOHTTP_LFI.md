## Remediation Steps for aiohttp Directory Traversal Test

The aiohttp Directory Traversal security vulnerability can potentially allow malicious users to read files outside the intended directories which could lead to private data being accessed.

### Step 1: Update aiohttp to the latest version

It's always a good practice to have the latest version of any software to ensure security patches are up-to-date, it is strongly recommended for aiohttp too.

```bash
pip install --upgrade aiohttp
```

### Step 2: Secure File Paths 

Ensure your application doesn't trust user input for accessing file paths. To prevent directory traversal attacks, validate and filter input data and use absolute paths. 

```python
import os
from aiohttp import web

async def handle(request):
  filename = request.match_info.get('filename', "")
  filename = os.path.basename(filename)  # restrict access to current directory
  filepath = os.path.join('/safe/directory', filename)

  return web.FileResponse(filepath)
```

### Step 3: Use an Allow-List 

Only permit known and safe file paths for users to prevent illegitimate access. This can be done by creating an allow-list of files and rejecting all requests that do not match the list.

```python
ALLOWED_PATHS = ['file1.txt', 'file2.txt']

async def handle(request):
  filename = request.match_info.get('filename', "")
  if filename not in ALLOWED_PATHS:
    return web.Response(status=403)

  filepath = os.path.join('/safe/directory', filename)

  return web.FileResponse(filepath)
```
