# Remediation for SPRING_MVC_LFI

## Remediation Steps for Spring MVC Local File Inclusion

Spring MVC Local File Inclusion is a significant security vulnerability. If not appropriately secured, attackers can perform a local file inclusion (LFI) attack, allowing them to include or read files on your application server.

### Step 1: Validate and sanitize user input 

Always validate and sanitize user inputs, especially if the input is used to load files within your application.

```java
String safeInput = SomeSanitizingLibrary.sanitize(userInput);
```

### Step 2: Avoid using user input directly to access file paths

Do not use variables controlled by the user to obtain internal files. Instead, use predefined mappings to user input.

```java
Map<String, String> safeMappings = new HashMap<>();
// Predefined mappings
safeMappings.put("option1","file1.txt");
safeMappings.put("option2","file2.txt");

String userOption = userInput;
String fileName = safeMappings.get(userOption);

if (fileName == null) {
   throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid option");
}

File file = new File(safeDirectory, fileName);
```

### Step 3:  Limit privileges and use chrooted Jails 

Wherever possible, it's safe to keep your application running with minimal system privileges. Also, consider using chrooted jails to limit the file access to isolated directories only.
