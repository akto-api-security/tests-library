# Remediation for FLASK_DEBUG_MODE_ENABLED

## Remediation Steps for Flask Debug Mode Enabled

Flask Debug Mode being enabled is a security risk as it allows the execution of arbitrary Python code, access to server environment variables, and reveals internal details of the application.

### Step 1: Disable Flask Debug Mode

You can disable Flask debug mode by setting the debug property of the application object to False in your Python source code. Below is an example in Python:

```python
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)
app.debug = False
```

### Step 2: Configure your Application for Production Environment
Make sure to set your environment to production when deploying your application. Flask considers "production" the default environment if not specified. You can specify the environment by setting the `FLASK_ENV` environment variable in bash:

```bash
export FLASK_ENV=production
```
   
### Step 3: Avoid Hardcoding Configuration Details
It is safer to avoid hardcoding the debug status of your application in your code. Instead, Flask allows you to use an environment variable, `FLASK_DEBUG`, to set the debug mode:

```bash
export FLASK_DEBUG=0
```
