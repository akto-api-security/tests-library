## Remediation Steps for Laravel Debug Mode Enabled

Having Laravel Debug Mode enabled is a security risk. It can expose sensitive data such as API keys, database credentials, etc., to potential attackers. Here's how to disable it.

### Step 1: Locate the .env file
In Laravel, the .env file in the root directory of the project is the main configuration file that holds various settings, including the debug mode status.

### Step 2: Modify the .env file

Find the row in the .env file that starts with `APP_DEBUG`. This option controls whether debug mode is on (`APP_DEBUG=true`) or off (`APP_DEBUG=false`).

To disable debug mode, set `APP_DEBUG` to `false`.

```bash
APP_DEBUG=false
```
Save your changes and close the file.

### Step 3: Clear configuration cache

After making changes to configuration files, it's a good idea to clear Laravel's configuration cache to ensure the new settings take effect. This can be done with the following command:

```bash
php artisan config:cache
```

### Step 4: Verify debug mode is off

Once you've completed the previous steps, verify that debug mode is off. Trying to access a non-existent route or creating another error that was previously visible because of debug mode is available, confirm that no debug information is exposed.
