# Remediation for OVERRIDE_DEFAULT_PAYMENT_METHODS

## Remediation Steps for Override Default Payment Methods
Overriding default payment methods could pose a security risk as it exposes your application to fraudulent activity and payment bypass schemes. The following steps and code example will guide you on how to avoid this issue by validating payment methods correctly.

### Step 1: Implement Strict Payment Method Validation
Before processing payments, ensure that the used payment method is one of the predefined and allowed payment methods. This validation needs to occur both on the client and server-side to strengthen security.
```javascript
const allowedPaymentMethods = ['visa', 'mastercard', 'paypal'];

function isValidPaymentMethod(method){
    return allowedPaymentMethods.indexOf(method) > -1;
}
```
### Step 2: Reviews and Updates
Review your payment methods and ensure they are up-to-date. Remove any payment options that are no longer supported and add new ones that are considered secure.

### Step 3: Secure Transmission of Payment Information
Always use SSL/TLS (HTTPS) while transmitting payment information to prevent interception of the sensitive data.
```
// Establishing secure HTTPS connection
var https = require('https');
```
### Step 4: Regular Auditing and Updates
```
// Regularly update your security measures
function updateSecurityChecks(){
    // Update code here
}

setInterval(updateSecurityChecks, 1000*60*60*24); // Run the function once every 24 hours
```
### Step 5: Privilege Least Privilege Principle
Use the Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP). Only grant the necessary permissions required for a user or service to function and limit the ability to change system configurations or payment methods.
```javascript
function grantPermission(userLevel){
    if(userLevel < 3){
        // Restrict permission
    }else{
        // Grant permission
    }
}
```
