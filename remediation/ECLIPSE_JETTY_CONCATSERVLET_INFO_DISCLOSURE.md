## Remediation Steps for Eclipse Jetty ConcatServlet Information Disclosure

The Eclipse Jetty `ConcatServlet` information disclosure vulnerability arises due to incorrect handling of requests by the `ConcatServlet` class. This issue can be exploited by appending several scripts and stylesheets together, which may allow an attacker to disclose sensitive information.

### Step 1: Update to the Latest Version
Ensure you are using the latest version of Eclipse Jetty that has patched the vulnerability.

```bash
wget "https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/eclipse/jetty/jetty-distribution/9.4.41.v20210516/jetty-distribution-9.4.41.v20210516.tar.gz"
tar -xzf jetty-distribution-9.4.41.v20210516.tar.gz
```
### Step 2: Disable the ConcatServlet

In your servlet configuration file (`web.xml` or equivalent), remove or comment out the `ConcatServlet` section.

```xml
<!-- Comment out or Remove the following section -->

<!-- <servlet>   
     <servlet-name>concat</servlet-name>
     <servlet-class>org.eclipse.jetty.servlets.ConcatServlet</servlet-class>
     <init-param>
        <param-name>precompressed</param-name>
        <param-value>.gz</param-value>
     </init-param>
  </servlet> -->
```

### Step 3: Regular Audit and Update

Regularly audit your application and keep all libraries and dependencies upto date. Following best practices for secure coding can prevent many security vulnerabilities.

```bash
# Check for Updates
mvn versions:display-dependency-updates

# Update Libraries
mvn versions:use-latest-versions
```

Please note that these steps are generic remedies. The actual steps may vary based on the Eclipse Jetty version and the server configuration. Always consult with a security professional when handling such issues.
