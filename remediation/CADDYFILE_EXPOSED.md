# Remediation for CADDYFILE_EXPOSED

## Remediation Steps for Caddyfile Exposure
Caddyfile Exposure is a dangerous security issue. If the Caddyfile is left exposed, it can result in unauthorized access or changes to the web server configuration. 

### Step 1: Secure your Caddyfile
Ensure that the Caddyfile is secured by setting proper permissions. Only authorized users should have read access, and only the owner should have write access. 

You can set permissions in a UNIX-type system using the chmod command. Run the following command which only allows the file owner to read and write the file:
```bash
chmod 600 Caddyfile
```
### Step 2: Restrict the Caddyfile location
Do not store the Caddyfile in an accessible portion of your web directory. It should be stored in a directory not served by your web server. The root directive in your Caddyfile can help control which directories are served.

### Step 3: Environment Configuration
Ensure your Caddy setup is configured to not display server information, which can give potential attackers useful insight into potential weaknesses.

In your Caddyfile, you can turn off the server's informational header with the following:
```caddy
header / {
    -Server
}
```
### Step 4: Regular Audit and Update
Make sure you always use the latest version of Caddy as it may include important security patches. Regular audits of your setup can help identify any misconfigurations or exposure early.
```bash
caddy upgrade
```
