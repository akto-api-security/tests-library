## Remediation Steps for Sensitive Data Exposure of Birth Information

Sensitive data exposure, especially birth data, can potentially lead to identity theft and other serious security issues. It's crucial to encrypt and secure such confidential data. Here are the remediation steps:

### Step 1: Encrypt Sensitive Data

If you're dealing with birth data or other sensitive information, always ensure that it's encrypted. Use a standard encryption algorithm like AES. Below is a simple example of data encryption in Python:

```python
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
import base64

def encrypt_info(info):
    secret_key = 'this is a secret key' 
    cipher = AES.new(secret_key,AES.MODE_ECB) 
    encoded = base64.b64encode(cipher.encrypt(info)) 
    return encoded
```

### Step 2: Secure Database Access

Limit the number of people who can access the birth date data and ensure their accounts have strong, unique passwords. Always use prepared statements when querying databases with user-supplied data to prevent SQL injections. Here's an example of a prepared statement in PHP:

```php
$stmt = $conn->prepare("SELECT birth_date FROM employees WHERE name = ?");
$stmt->bind_param("s", $_POST['name']); 
$stmt->execute();
$result = $stmt->get_result();
```

### Step 3: Use HTTPS Protocol

Make sure all data transfer is done over secure HTTPS protocol. This encrypts all communication between the server and the client, making it more difficult for attackers to intercept sensitive data.

```apache
<VirtualHost *:80>
   ServerName www.example.com
   Redirect / https://www.example.com/
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost *:443>
   ServerName www.example.com
   DocumentRoot /var/www/example.com
   SSLEngine on
   SSLCertificateFile /path/to/www.example.com.cert
   SSLCertificateKeyFile /path/to/www.example.com.key
</VirtualHost>
```
