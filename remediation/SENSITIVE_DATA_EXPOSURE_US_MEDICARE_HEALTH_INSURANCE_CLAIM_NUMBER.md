## Remediation Steps for Sensitive Data Exposure of US MEDICARE HEALTH INSURANCE CLAIM NUMBER

Exposing sensitive data like US MEDICARE HEALTH INSURANCE CLAIM NUMBER can lead to significant privacy violations. It's crucial to implement appropriate protection for such information.

The remediation process can be taken in several steps, primarily focusing on data encryption, proper access control, data sanitation, and following the principle of least privilege.

### Step 1: Data Encryption
Use encryption algorithms to protect sensitive data. Here's an example in Python using pyCrypto:

```python
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
import base64

def encrypt_info(info):
    Block_Size = 16
    Padding = '{'
    pad = lambda s: s + (Block_Size - len(s) % Block_Size) * Padding
    EncodeAES = lambda c, s: base64.b64encode(c.encrypt(pad(s)))
    key = 'your_key_here'
    cipher = AES.new(key)
    encoded = EncodeAES(cipher, info)
    return encoded
```

Make sure to replace `'your_key_here'` with a proper secret key.

### Step 2: Data Access Control 
Ensure only authenticated and authorized users can access sensitive information.

```java
public class SecurityService {
    
    public boolean isUserAuthorized(User user, MedicareClaim claim) {
        // implement your business logic to check whether the granted user has access to the claim
    }
    
}
```
Replace `// implement your business logic to check whether the granted user has access to the claim` with the actual business logic.

### Step 3: Data Sanitization 
Ensure to sanitize data that is going to be displayed or logged, preventing the exposure of sensitive information to the wrong parties.

```C#
public class DataSanitization
{
    public string SanitizeData(string claimData)
    {
        // Make sure to implement a method that sanitizes your data
        return sanitizedData;
    }
}
```

Replace `// Make sure to implement a method that sanitizes your data` with the actual sanitization process.

### Step 4: Follow Principle of Least Privilege
Ensure each component (user, process, systemâ€¦) of a computing environment has the minimum data and resources necessary to perform its function.

Implement proper user roles and access levels in databases, file systems, and other data storage solutions:
```sql
CREATE ROLE read_only;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO read_only;
```
