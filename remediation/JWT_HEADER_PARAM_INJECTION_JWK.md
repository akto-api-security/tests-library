# Remediation for JWT_HEADER_PARAM_INJECTION_JWK

## Remediation Steps for Authentication Bypass using JWT Header Param Injection with JWK

Authentication Bypass using JWT Header Param Injection with JWK is a severe security vulnerability. Attackers can manipulate JWT tokens to bypass authentication routes, thereby gaining unauthorized access to system resources and data.

### Step 1: Validate the JWT with JWK
The JWK (JSON Web Key) must be used to validate the JWT (JSON Web Token). The "alg" parameter in the JWT header must be compared to ensure it aligns with the algorithm specified in the JWK stored on the server.

Hereâ€™s a sample code in Python to perform this check:

```python
from jwcrypto.jwk import JWK
from jwcrypto.jwt import JWT

def validate_jwt(jwt_token, jwk_key):
    jwk = JWK.from_json(jwk_key)
    JWT(key=jwk, jwt=jwt_token)  # If the JWT is invalid or the signature doesn't match an exception will be raised
```

### Step 2: Avoid None Algorithm
Do not use "none" as the signing algorithm in JWT. This can allow for a type of attack where the attacker can change the "alg" field in the JWT header to "none" and the signature validation is skipped. Enforce the check in your code:

```python
def validate_alg(jwt_token):
    header = jwt.get_unverified_header(jwt_token)
    if header['alg'] == 'none':
        raise Exception('Invalid alg: none')
```

### Step 3: Use Secure JWK Set URI
Do not use user-provided JWK Set URI, always use predetermined secure URIs to avoid JWK injection.
