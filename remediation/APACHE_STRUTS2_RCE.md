# Remediation for APACHE_STRUTS2_RCE

## Remediation Steps for Apache Struts2 Remote Code Execution

Remote Code Execution (RCE) is a serious security issue that can allow attackers to execute their own, potentially malicious, code on your system. In the case of Apache Struts2, this vulnerability can often lead to privileged access and control over your application servers.

### Step 1: Update Apache Struts2

The primary means of remediating this vulnerability is by keeping the Apache Struts2 framework up-to-date. Many versions of Apache Struts2 are susceptible to RCE, particularly before version 2.3.35 and version 2.5.17. Make sure to update to the latest recommended versions.

```bash
sudo wget https://downloads.apache.org/struts/2.5.22/struts-2.5.22-all.zip
unzip struts-2.5.22-all.zip
sudo rm struts-2.5.22-all.zip
```
Replace the existing Struts2 JAR files in your project with the ones from the unzip command.

### Step 2: Apply Security Patches

Ensure all security patches are applied as soon as they are available. This remediation step is crucial as they often contain fixes for known vulnerabilities. Make use of Apache Struts libraries that come with patches for known vulnerabilities.

```bash
# Assuming you use Maven as a build tool
mvn clean install 
```
This will fetch the latest Struts2 libraries with installed security patches.

### Step 3: Remove Unnecessary Components

Eliminate any unnecessary components in your web application, as these can often magnify vulnerabilities and make your system more susceptible to attacks.

```java
// bad practice
<constant name="struts.devMode" value="true" />

// good practice
<constant name="struts.devMode" value="false" />
```
