## Remediation Steps for XML External Entity (XXE) Vulnerability with Parameter Entity for File Disclosure in API Endpoints

XXE vulnerabilities can allow an attacker to interfere with an application's processing of XML data. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to access internal files, interact with any system that the application can access, or execute a denial-of-service attack.

### Step 1: Disable Document Type Definitions (DTDs)
Disabling DTDs is a crucial step towards preventing XXE vulnerabilities. Here's an example of how you could do this in Java:

```java
DocumentBuilderFactory dbf = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();
String FEATURE = "http://apache.org/xml/features/disallow-doctype-decl";
dbf.setFeature(FEATURE, true);
```

### Step 2: Disable External Entities and External Document Type Declarations
This snippet is a direct follow up from the previous one. It continues to define settings that will help safeguard the API.

```java
FEATURE = "http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities";
dbf.setFeature(FEATURE, false);

FEATURE = "http://xml.org/sax/features/external-parameter-entities";
dbf.setFeature(FEATURE, false);

FEATURE = "http://apache.org/xml/features/nonvalidating/load-external-dtd";
dbf.setXIncludeAware(false);
dbf.setExpandEntityReferences(false);
```

Change your XML parser configuration to make it immune to XXE attacks.

### Step 3: Use Less Complex Data Formats
Where possible, use simpler data formats such as JSON, and avoid serialization of sensitive data.

### Step 4: Validate, Sanitize, And Escape User Inputs
Ensure that all user input is validated, sanitized and safe to use in an XML document. This approach can complement a strong policy against including user-controllable data in XML documents.
