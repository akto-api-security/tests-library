## Remediation Steps for Command Injection on Windows Systems

Command injection is a high-risk vulnerability that can give an attacker control over a system. In a Windows environment, it typically occurs when unsanitized user input is executed using system specific operations.

### Step 1: Validate and Sanitize Input
All user inputs should be validated and sanitized using regular expressions or built-in language functions. Here's an example in C#:

```csharp
string userInput = GetInput();
string safeInput = System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex.Replace(userInput, "[^a-zA-Z0-9]", "");
```

### Step 2: Use Parameterized Queries
Avoid executing commands directly based on user input. Use parameterized queries or prepared statements when dealing with a database. 

An example in SQL via C#:
```csharp
SqlCommand command = new SqlCommand("SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Name = @name", connection);
command.Parameters.Add(new SqlParameter("name", safeInput));
```

### Step 3: Implement Least Privilege Principle
Your application should run with the least privilege necessary. This will limit the potential damage if a command injection does occur.
