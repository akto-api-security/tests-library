## Remediation Steps for Sensitive Data Exposure for AUTH

Sensitive data exposure related to authentication is a serious security issue. Encryption is one of the methods to protect sensitive data from exposure. The remediation involves encrypting all sensitive data in transit and at rest.

### Step 1: Encrypt data at rest

In your database, ensure that all sensitive data is encrypted. Here's an example on how you can do this using SQL Server:

```SQL
CREATE SYMMETRIC KEY SecureSymmetricKey
    WITH ALGORITHM = AES_256
    ENCRYPTION BY PASSWORD = 'Password1234';

OPEN SYMMETRIC KEY SecureSymmetricKey
    DECRYPTION BY PASSWORD = 'Password1234';

UPDATE tbl_Users
SET Password = ENCRYPTBYKEY(KEY_GUID('SecureSymmetricKey'), Password)
WHERE UserId = 123;
CLOSE SYMMETRIC KEY SecureSymmetricKey;
```

### Step 2: Encrypt data in transit

Ensure that all data sent over the network is encrypted using SSL (Secure Sockets Layer). Hereâ€™s an example of how to do this in Java:

```Java
SSLServerSocketFactory sslserversocketfactory = (SSLServerSocketFactory) SSLServerSocketFactory.getDefault();
ServerSocket serversocket = sslserversocketfactory.createServerSocket(9999);
// create server socket
SSLSocket sslsocket = (SSLSocket) serversocket.accept();
```

### Step 3: Proper session management

Ensure that you do proper session management. Use secure server-side sessions.

```python
from flask import Flask, session
app = Flask(__name__)
app.secret_key = 'super secret key'
@app.route('/')
def index():
    session['key'] = 'value'
    return "index"
```

These steps, when implemented, will help in remediation of any potential risk of sensitive data exposure for AUTH.
