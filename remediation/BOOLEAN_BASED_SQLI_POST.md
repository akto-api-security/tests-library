# Remediation for BOOLEAN_BASED_SQLI_POST

## Remediation Steps for Boolean Based SQL Injection on POST Method APIs

Boolean-Based SQL injection is a serious security vulnerability. Attackers might exploit poorly secured Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to gain unauthorized access to your data. 

### Step 1: Use Prepared Statements

The most effective way to prevent SQL injection is to use Prepared Statements with Parameterized Queries. These types of queries ensure that an attacker is not able to change the intent of a query, even if SQL commands are inserted by an attacker.

In the example below, we are using a Prepared Statement in PHP:

```php
$stmt = $pdo->prepare('SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name = :name');

$stmt->execute(['name' => $name]);

foreach ($stmt as $row) {
    // do something with $row
}
```
In the above code, the ":name" in the SQL query is a parameter which we can bind any value to. Even if the value comes from an untrusted source (user input), it is never inserted directly into the query string, hence SQL injection is effectively prevented.

### Step 2: Use an ORM or a Database Abstraction Layer

Most modern Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) libraries and Database Abstraction Layers offer protection against SQL injections. If you have the opportunity to use one with this functionality, you should do so. Here's an example in Django (Python):

```python
from django.db import models

class Blog(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100) 

# Then, when creating a new object:
blog = Blog(name='My Blog')
blog.save()
```
### Step 3: Always Limit Database Permissions

Does the code being executed really need complete access to the database? It's good security practice to only give as much power as necessary.

### Step 4: Regular Code Review and Security Retesting 

Regularly revisit your code and audit it for lapses in security, updating where necessary. Security is an ongoing effort, not a one-time fix.
