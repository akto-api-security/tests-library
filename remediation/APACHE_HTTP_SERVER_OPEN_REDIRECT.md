## Remediation Steps for Apache HTTP Server Open Redirect

Open Redirect is a security issue where an attacker can redirect a user to an untrusted website through your website. Without properly patching and securing Apache HTTP Server, attackers may exploit Open Redirect vulnerabilities and may attempt phishing or information disclosure attacks. 

Here are the steps to remediate:

### Step 1: Identify vulnerable locations
The first step is identifying where open redirect vulnerabilities lie. This could be anywhere you use redirect requests. Audit your codebase and identify such spots.

### Step 2: Utilize proper URL validation
After identifying such places, it is essential that you are only redirecting to trusted URLs. Apache does not have a built-in feature to handle this, you need to implement it yourself. Here, is an example in Python where only trusted URLs from your domain are allowed. 
```python
import urlparse
...
def safe_redirect(url, next_url):
    parsed_url = urlparse.urlparse(next_url)
    if parsed_url.netloc is not None:
        if parsed_url.netloc == urlparse.urlparse(url).netloc:
            return True
        else:
            return False
    return False
...
```
