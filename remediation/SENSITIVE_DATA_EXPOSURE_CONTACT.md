# Remediation for SENSITIVE_DATA_EXPOSURE_CONTACT

## Remediation Steps for Sensitive Data Exposure for CONTACT

Sensitive data exposure is a critical security flaw that may result in unauthorized access to confidential data. When it comes to the 'CONTACT' information, if it's not accurately protected, it can be readily obtained and misused by malicious users. These remediation steps are applicable for Python language, using the Flask web framework and SQLAlchemy ORM.

### Step 1: Encrypt sensitive data
Sensitive data (in this case 'CONTACT') should be encrypted using appropriate encryption techniques before storing it in the database.

```python
from flask_bcrypt import Bcrypt

bcrypt = Bcrypt()

# to generate a hashed password
hashed_contact = bcrypt.generate_password_hash('contact')
```

### Step 2: Validate Data Input
Make sure all user inputs, not only the 'CONTACT' data, are confirmed for correctness to prevent harmful data from being stored.

```python
from wtforms import Form, StringField, validators

class ContactForm(Form):
    contact = StringField('Contact', [validators.Length(min=10, max=15)])
```

### Step 3: Use Secure Transmissions
Use secure transmission protocols like HTTPS to transit the 'CONTACT' data from client to server safely.

### Step 4: Use Regular Access Controls
Regularly check who is accessing the data and put in place strong access control checks.

```python
from flask_login import UserMixin, login_required

class User(UserMixin, db.Model):
    # ...

# restrict access to route to only logged in users
@app.route('/contact')
@login_required
def contact():
    # ...
```

### Step 5: Regular Security Audits
Regularly audit and update your security measures. This should be a continuous process as new threats and vulnerabilities are found often.
