# Remediation for COMMAND_INJECTION_WITH_REDIRECTION_AND_VAR_MANIPULATION_CHAINED

## Remediation Steps for Command Injection using Redirection and Variable Manipulation

Command injection using redirection and variable manipulation is a serious security issue. If left unchecked, an attacker can use the manipulation of environment variables and redirection to perform malicious activities. 

The following are guidelines to remediate this vulnerability:

### Step 1: Avoid executing system commands as much as possible

It is advised to make use of language specific functionality rather than direct system commands.

### Step 2: Sanitize inputs

If the use of system commands is unavoidable, sanitize user input to avoid injection attacks. The following Python code shows an example of sanitizing user inputs:

```python
import shlex
import subprocess

command = input("Enter your command: ") #user input
sanitized_command = shlex.split(command)
subprocess.run(sanitized_command)
```

### Step 3: Use parameterized API's or Libraries

Use parameterized API's while running system commands. In the case of Node.js, use `child_process.execFile()` function. It takes command line arguments in an array, each treated as distinct arguments:

```javascript
const { execFile } = require('child_process');

const userArgs = ["arg1", "arg2", "arg3"];
execFile('command', userArgs, (error, stdout, stderr) => {
    if (error) {
        throw error;
    }
    console.log(stdout);
});
```

### Step 4: Use of least privileges

Limit the permissions of the executing process. Always adhere to the principle of least privilege. If the process does not need to perform system commands, then the process does not need the ability to do so. 

### Step 5: Enabled system auditing

It's also important to enable and correctly configure logging and auditing. Robust log management can help in identifying attack attempts and managing the actions of privileged users.

### Step 6: Regular Code Review and Security Testing

Conduct regular code reviews and penetration testing to check for any potential flaws or vulnerabilities.
