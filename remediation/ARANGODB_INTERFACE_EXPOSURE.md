# Remediation for ARANGODB_INTERFACE_EXPOSURE

## Remediation Steps for ArangoDB Web Interface Exposure

ArangoDB Web Interface Exposure presents a substantial security issue. Without properly securing the interface, it can be exploited allowing unauthorized amendments to the database or access to sensitive information.

### Step 1: Limit Access to Web Interface

Configure the ArangoDB to bind to localhost (127.0.0.1) only to prevent connections from other hosts. You can do this by modifying the arangodb.conf file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/arangodb3/arangod.conf
```

Locate [network] section and change the endpoint to loopback IP:

```bash
[network]
endpoint = tcp://127.0.0.1:8529
```

Save and close the configuration file.

### Step 2: Restart ArangoDB Service

After the configuration changes, ensure to restart ArangoDB service for the changes to take effect:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart arangodb3
```

### Step 3: Firewall Configuration

Make sure to configure your firewall to only allow ingress traffic on the ArangoDB port (default is 8529) from trusted IP addresses:

```bash
sudo ufw allow from trusted_ip to any port 8529
```
Replace `trusted_ip` with the IP address that you want to allow.

### Step 4: Regular Audit and Update

ArangoDB, like any other software, should be regularly updated to ensure any known vulnerabilities are patched:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade arangodb3
```
Don't forget to follow best practices regarding password management, privileges assignments, and data validation. 

Even though the measures listed above will increase the security of your ArangoDB, it is recommended to have a professional penetration test conducted against your setup, especially for production environments.
