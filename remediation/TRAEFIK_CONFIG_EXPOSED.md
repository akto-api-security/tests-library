# Remediation for TRAEFIK_CONFIG_EXPOSED

## Remediation Steps for Traefik Config Exposure
Traefik Config Exposure is a notable security issue. Attackers can potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive information if the Traefik configuration files are exposed. 

### Step 1: Authentication Control
Add basic authentication to your Traefik dashboard.
```toml
[entryPoints]
  [entryPoints.dashboard]
    address = ":8080"
    [entryPoints.dashboard.auth]
      [entryPoints.dashboard.auth.basic]
        users = ["user:$apr1$random$random"]
```
With the above configuration, `user` is your username and `$apr1$random$random` is the hashed version of your password. 

### Step 2: Enable TLS
Enable TLS on the entry point. Here's how to enable it with Let's Encrypt.
```toml
[entryPoints]
  [entryPoints.web]
    address = ":80"
  [entryPoints.websecure]
    address = ":443"
    
[http]
  [http.routers]
    [http.routers.router0]
      entryPoints = ["web"]
      middlewares = ["httpsredirect"]
      service = "my-service"
      rule = "Host(`example.com`)"
      [http.routers.router0.tls]
        certresolver = "myresolver"
        
[certificatesResolvers]
  [certificatesResolvers.myresolver.acme]
    email = "your-email@example.com"
    storage = "acme.json"
    [certificatesResolvers.myresolver.acme.httpChallenge]
      # used during the challenge
      entryPoint = "web"
```

### Step 3: Make sure your config files are not in publicly accessible paths

### Step 4: Regularly Update and Monitor
Ensure Traefik is regularly updated to the latest version and continuously monitor for any irregularities or breaches. If there are changes in the settings that you did not make, investigate them promptly.
