## Remediation Steps for Overreliance on LLMs

Overreliance on Low-Level Micro-operations (LLMs) such as using C++ to generate full malware can be a serious security risk. This is because LLMs can expose the system to potential vulnerabilities. Here is how you can mitigate this issue.

### Step 1: Minimize Use of Low-level Operations
Avoid writing low-level code whenever possible. Leverage modern, widely-used libraries and programming languages that have been audited for security. For instance, switch to using high-level languages like Python or Ruby that handle memory management for you â€” these languages are less prone to vulnerabilities associated LLMs.

```Python
# Example of safe code in Python
try:
    dangerous_operation()
except PotentialException:
    log_error_and_abort()
```
