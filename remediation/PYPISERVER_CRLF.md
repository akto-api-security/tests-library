## Remediation Steps for Pypiserver Carriage Return Line Feed (CRLF) Injection

Pypiserver Carriage Return Line Feed (CRLF) injection is a security issue where an attacker is able to manipulate the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) headers via CRLF sequences. By doing this, an attacker can perform different malicious activities like HTTP response splitting and session hijacking. Here are the steps to fix this vulnerability:

### Step 1: Update Pypiserver Package

Make sure you are running the latest package of Pypiserver. Updates often integrate patches for security vulnerabilities. You can update Pypiserver via pip utility:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pypiserver
```

### Step 2: Validate Input 

Always validate the user-supplied data to ensure it does not contain CRLF sequences before inserting it in the HTTP headers. Here is the example in Python:

```python
def safe_input(user_input):
    return user_input.replace('\n', '').replace('\r', '')
```

### Step 3: Use Web Application Firewalls

Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) can detect and mitigate CRLF injection attacks. Make sure to enable and properly configure your WAF.
