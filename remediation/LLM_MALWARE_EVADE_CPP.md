## Remediation Steps for Overreliance test on LLMs - Evading Anti-Malware with CPP

Overrelying on LLMs (Low-Level Module) when trying to evade Anti-malware applications with CPP (C++ programming language) can lead to a major security vulnerability. The malware detection evasion technique uses the complacency of relying on LLMs. Here are possible steps to secure the application:

### Step 1: Isolation of Modules

Ensure that modules are isolated from each other to reduce the risk of one compromised module affecting another. 

```cpp
class Module {
    public:
    // module code

    private:
    // ensure module data is private
};
```

### Step 2: Implement Anti-Tampering Mechanisms 

Ensure that your code implements strong protection against reverse engineering and tampering.

```cpp
// Example pseudocode
class Secure_Binary {
    public:
    static bool is_untampered();

    private:
    static const hash binary_sha256;
};
```
