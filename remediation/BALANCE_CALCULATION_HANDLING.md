# Remediation for BALANCE_CALCULATION_HANDLING

## Remediation Steps for Account Balance Calculation Flaw
Account Balance Calculation Flaw is a critical issue which can lead to financial loss if not rectified as soon as possible. This flaw may allow unauthorized modification of account balances, leading to transactions that overdraw accounts or incorrect account balances being displayed.

### Step 1: Verify Calculation Logic
The first step is to thoroughly review the calculation logic in your code to ensure it accurately maintains and computes account balance information. This could be the part of the code that handles deposits, withdraws or transfers.

For example, if you're using JavaScript, you might have code like this:

```javascript
// An example flawed code
function deposit(account, amount) {
  account.balance += amount;
}

function withdraw(account, amount) {
  if (account.balance < amount) {
    throw new Error('Insufficient balance');
  }
  account.balance -= amount;
}
```

In this example, both the deposit and withdraw functions modify the balance without taking into account potential concurrent modifications, causing race conditions.

### Step 2: Introduce Transaction Locks
To solve the race condition issue, introduce transaction locks to ensure the balance cannot be changed by any other transaction until the current one is completed. 

This can be achieved using the async-lock library in Node.js:

```javascript
const AsyncLock = require('async-lock');
const lock = new AsyncLock();

// The deposit and withdraw functions updated with the unlocked status
function deposit(account, amount) {
  lock.acquire(account.id, function() {
    account.balance += amount;
  });
}

function withdraw(account, amount) {
  lock.acquire(account.id, function() {
    if (account.balance < amount) {
      throw new Error('Insufficient balance');
    }
    account.balance -= amount;
  });
}
```

### Step 3: Test Your Code
The changes in the calculation method should be thoroughly tested to ensure no miscalculations occur. This can be achieved using automated testing.

### Step 4: Code Reviews and Regular Audits
Lastly, regular code audits and constant reviews can help ensure that any flaws introduced in the future are quickly identified and corrected. 

Make sure to pay special attention to the critical code sections that handle account balance computations and transactions.
