# Remediation for SSRF_ON_IMAGE_UPLOAD_GCP_REDIRECT

## Remediation Steps for GCP Details Exposure due to SSRF

Exposure of Google Cloud Platform (GCP) details via Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) is a serious security concern. Without properly securing the query parameter, attackers might be able to redirect requests to internal resources which can lead to data exposure.

### Step 1: Validate URLs

Validating and verifying the URLs is one of the first steps to prevent SSRF attacks. Only validated URLs and domains should be accepted.

```python
def is_valid_url(url):
    from urllib.parse import urlparse
    parsed = urlparse(url)
    domain = parsed.netloc
    if domain not in ALLOWED_DOMAINS:
        return False
    else:
        return True
```

### Step 2: Block Private IPs

Block all private (non-routable) IP addresses on the server to prevent attacks on the local network.

```python
def is_ip_public(ip):
    import ipaddress
    ip_addr = ipaddress.ip_address(ip)
    if ip_addr.is_private:
        return False
    else:
        return True
```

### Step 3: Use a Safe HTTP Client

Utilize an HTTP client that doesn't follow redirects.

```python
import requests

def fetch(url):
    return requests.get(url, allow_redirects=False)
```
 
### Step 4: Regular Audit and Update

Regularly update and audit your application to stay secure from new threats and vulnerabilities. Ensure prompt deployment of patches and updates from official sources.

### Step 5: Implement Least Privilege

Implementation of least privilege is recommended. Only necessary permissions should be granted and unnecessary ones should be rescinded to minimize potential attack surface. For GCP, this can be achieved through IAM policies.

```bash
gcloud projects get-iam-policy myproject
gcloud projects set-iam-policy myproject my_policy.json
```

### Step 6: Encrypt Sensitive Data

It is recommended to encrypt sensitive data stored in GCP. For instance, if storing sensitive data in Cloud Storage, use Customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK).

```bash
gsutil kms encryption -k projects/$(gcloud config get-value project)/locations/global/keyRings/my_ring/cryptoKeys/my_key gs://my_bucket
```
