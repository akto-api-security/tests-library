# Remediation for PAYMENT_GATEWAY_SQL_INJECTION_POSTGRESQL_GET

## Remediation Steps for SQL Injection on Payment Gateway API

SQL Injection on a Payment Gateway API poses a severe security risk as it can allow attackers to manipulate or extract sensitive data from your database. This issue can be addressed by applying techniques such as input validation, parameterized queries, stored procedures, and escaping user-supplied input.

### Step 1: Input Validation
Ensure all user-provided data is valid before using it in a SQL query. A simple way to do this is by using regex patterns which describe accepted input. 

```java
public boolean isValidName(String name){
    Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile("^[a-zA-Z0-9]*$");
    Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher(name);
    return matcher.matches();
}
```

### Step 2: Parameterized Queries
Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to separate SQL code from data. This way, the database knows exactly what is code and what is data, preventing any injected code from being executed.

```java
String selectSQL = "SELECT USER_ID, USERNAME FROM USERS WHERE USER_ID = ?";
PreparedStatement preparedStatement = dbConnection.prepareStatement(selectSQL);
preparedStatement.setInt(1, 1001);
ResultSet rs = preparedStatement.executeQuery(selectSQL );
```

### Step 3: Stored Procedures
Use stored procedures as they are parameterized by default and help to prevent SQLi attacks. Stored procedures execute predefined queries, preventing users from modifying the SQL code.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION fetch_user(IN p_id integer)
RETURNS TABLE(user_id integer, username text) 
AS
$BODY$
BEGIN
 RETURN QUERY SELECT user_id, username FROM users WHERE user_id = p_id;
END;
$BODY$
LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

### Step 4: Escaping User Input
Escaping user input is another critical preventative measure. Special characters are escaped by adding a leading backslash, ensuring they are not interpreted as part of the SQL code.

In Java, you'd use `StringEscapeUtils.escapeSql()` from Apache Commons Lang Library:

```java
String safe = StringEscapeUtils.escapeSql( userSuppliedString );
```

### Step 5: Least Privileged User
Use a least-privileged user account to connect to the database. This account should only have the minimum necessary permissions, limiting the potential damage of an attack. 

```sql
CREATE USER myuser WITH LOGIN NOSUPERUSER INHERIT NOCREATEDB NOCREATEROLE NOREPLICATION;
```
