# Remediation for SSRF_ON_CSV_UPLOAD_AWS_REDIRECT

## Remediation Steps for Sensitive AWS Details Exposure due to SSRF
Exposure of sensitive AWS details due to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) is a potentially severe security issue. Attackers can take advantage of SSRF vulnerabilities to bypass access controls, such as firewalls, that are intended to prevent client requests from reaching internal networks.

### Step 1: Validate and Sanitize User Input
Make sure that all incoming data is properly validated and sanitized in your application. Below is a simple example in Python:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse

def validate_url(url):
    parsed = urlparse(url)
    if parsed.netloc == 'localhost':
        raise ValueError('Invalid URL')
```

### Step 2: Avoid Exposing Internal Services
Never expose your internal services to the outside world. Make sure you have firewall settings that prevent this.

### Step 3: Restrict Outbound Requests
SSRF relies on requests from the vulnerable server to the target server. Hence, being able to only allow necessary outbound requests can limit the damage.

### Step 4: Use Updated Libraries/Packages
Ensure all your dependencies and packages are up-to-date and patched for known vulnerabilities. Regularly check sources like the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) for past vulnerabilities in the packages you use.

### Step 5: Use AWS IAM Roles
Use IAM roles to delegate permissions to applications that you run on AWS resources. An application can specify the IAM role when you launch an instance.

```shell
aws iam create-role --role-name my-config-role --assume-role-policy-document file://TrustPolicyForConfig.txt
```

### Step 6: Regular Security Audits
Regularly audit your application and AWS environment to detect and prevent vulnerabilities. 

```shell
aws auditmanager get-assessment-report --assessment-id ExampleId 
```

By following these remediation steps, your application can be made more secure against SSRF and potential AWS details leakage.
