## Remediation Steps for Sensitive GCP Details Exposure

Sensitive Google Cloud Platform (GCP) details exposed via replacing XML parameter with redirection due to Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) can pose a severe security risk. Following the steps below will help in remediation of this problem.

### Step 1: Avoid Using User Input for URL Redirection 

This can be achieved by caching the URLs of known sites and referencing them based on user input rather than directly using the input itself. Here's an example in JavaScript:

```javascript
var urlMap = { 
  "site1": "https://url1.com", 
  "site2": "https://url2.com"
}

var userInput = "site1"; // this is the user input

var redirectURL = urlMap[userInput];

if (redirectURL) {
  response.writeHead(301,{Location: redirectURL}); // Node.js redirection
  response.end();
} else{
  // handle unknown sites
}
```

### Step 2: Validate and Sanitize User Inputs 

Before using user input as part of a URL or as parameters in an API request, make sure to validate and sanitize it. 

For example, in Python, using the `lxml` library:

```python
from lxml import etree
userInput = '<xml></xml>' # XML input from the user

# parse and clean XML
root = etree.fromstring(userInput)
cleanInput = etree.tostring(root, pretty_print=True, xml_declaration=True)
```

### Step 3: Restrict SSRF by Restricting HTTP(S) Requests 

To mitigate the risk of SSRF, you can restrict HTTP(s) requests to trusted domains. This can be achieved by creating an allow-list of trusted domains and avoid any outbound requests to non-trusted sites.
