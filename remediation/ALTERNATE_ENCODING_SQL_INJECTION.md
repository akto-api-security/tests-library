# Remediation for ALTERNATE_ENCODING_SQL_INJECTION

## Remediation Steps for SQL Injection test using Alternate Encoding
SQL Injection using alternate encoding is a serious security issue. Attackers can manipulate SQL queries through input fields in your application and alter encoding to bypass basic security controls. This risk can be mitigated by using parameterized queries, prepared statements, or stored procedures, and validating and sanitizing inputs.

### Step 1: Use Parameterized Queries or Prepared Statements
Depending on the language you are programming in, parameterized queries or prepared statements can be used to avoid SQL Injection. Here is an example in Python with `psycopg2` and PostgreSQL.

```python
import psycopg2

def get_user(id):
    conn = psycopg2.connect("dbname=test user=postgres password=secret")
    cur = conn.cursor()
    cur.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = %s", (id,))
    return cur.fetchone()
```

In this case, user input isn't directly added into the SQL command. Instead, it's sent to the database separately so it can't interfere with the query's structure.

### Step 2: Input Validation and Sanitization
Avoid SQL injections by validating and sanitizing all user inputs. Never trust incoming data. In Python, you can use a library like `python-string-sanitizer`

```python
from sanitize_text import sanitize

def get_user(id):
    id = sanitize(id)
    # Proceed with the SQL query
```

### Step 3: Use Principle of Least Privilege
Limit the privileges of databases users. They should only have just enough access rights to perform their job. If you're using PostgreSQL, here's an example on how to limit user privileges.

```SQL
REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE mydb FROM public;
GRANT connect ON DATABASE mydb TO dbuser;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO dbuser;
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO dbuser;
```
