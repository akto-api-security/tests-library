# Remediation for SENSITIVE_DATA_EXPOSURE_UUID

## Remediation Steps for Sensitive Data Exposure for UUID

Secure UUID exposure is a serious security issue that can lead to unauthorized access and information leakage. To mitigate this vulnerability, one must employ encryption techniques, such as hashing, to obscure the UUIDs.

### Step 1: Secure UUID Generation
The first step is to generate secure UUIDs. Avoid generating predictable UUIDs and use secure libraries that generate random UUIDs. Here's an example of secure UUID generation in Python.
```python
import uuid
secure_random_uuid = uuid.uuid4()
```

### Step 2: Hashing the UUID
After generating the UUID, the next step is to hash the UUID before storing or transmitting. The `hashlib` library in Python can be used for this purpose.
```python
import hashlib
hashed_uuid = hashlib.sha256(secure_random_uuid.bytes).hexdigest()
```

### Step 3: Use HTTPS for Transport
Ensure the secure transmission of UUIDs. Always use HTTPS for transport to prevent "man in the middle" attacks where the UUID could be intercepted.

### Step 4: Limit UUID Exposure
Limit the exposure of UUIDs in logs, error messages, URLs, etc. UUIDs should be considered as sensitive data, even if they do not directly contain personally identifiable information.
