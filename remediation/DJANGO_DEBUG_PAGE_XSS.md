## Remediation Steps for Django Debug Page Cross-Site Scripting

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a type of security vulnerability that enables attackers to inject malicious scripts into the web pages viewed by other users. Django Debug Page XSS refers to where an attacker might take advantage of Django's debug mode to execute malicious scripts. This can lead to session theft, account tampering, or malicious redirections among other things.

### Step 1: Turn Off Debug Mode

In Django, debug mode should never be used in a production setting as it provides a lot of information that is useful for debugging but harmful if exposed to the public. 

```python
# settings.py 
DEBUG = False
```

### Step 2: Validate and Sanitize Input 

Always validate and sanitize input, use Django’s built-in validators, or write your own custom validators.

```python
from django.core.exceptions import ValidationError 

# Custom validation example 
def validate_content(value): 
    if "<script>" in value:  # simple example, you should use a more robust method 
        raise ValidationError("Invalid content - scripting not allowed") 
```

Remember to properly handle the ValidationError in your view.

### Step 3: Use Django’s CSRF Protection 

Django comes with CSRF protection middleware which generates and checks tokens with each POST request. This should be included in every Django project.

```python
# settings.py
MIDDLEWARE = [
    'django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware',
    'django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware',
    'django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware',
    'django.middleware.csrf.CsrfViewMiddleware',
    ... # insert remaining middleware 
]
```

In your templates, use csrf_token within your forms.

```html
<form method="post">
    {% csrf_token %}
    <!-- form fields here -->
</form>
```
