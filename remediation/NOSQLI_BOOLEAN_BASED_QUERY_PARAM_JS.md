## Remediation Steps for Boolean Based NoSQL Injection

A NoSQL Injection is a security issue that might allow an attacker to control or execute malicious commands on the database. This issue is often caused by the lack of proper input sanitization. 

### Step 1: Input Validation
Always validate user inputs before using them in a database query. You can do this using several built-in JavaScript functions. You can use the `typeof` function to ensure that the input is the desired type.  

```javascript
if (typeof user_input !== 'string') {
    throw new TypeError('Expected a string');
}
```

### Step 2: Parameterized Queries
Using parameterized queries can also help avoid NoSQL injection. This ensures that the database treats all user input data as literal strings, not part of the SQL command. Most JavaScript Database drivers support this functionality.


```javascript
const query = {_id: '...'};

db.collection.find(query, function(err, user) {
  console.log(user);
});
```

### Step 3: Use ORM / ODM or Database Abstraction Layers
Another approach to prevent NoSQL injections is to use an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) or Object Document Mapper (ODM) that abstracts database commands and prohibits direct command injections.

```javascript
var User = mongoose.model('User', yourSchema);
User.find({ name: 'john', password: 'secret' }, function (err, user) {
  console.log(user);
});
```

### Step 4: Database Software Security Features
Ensure that the security features provided by the NoSQL database software are enabled and properly configured. These may include features such as TLS/SSL support, RBAC, and audit logging.
