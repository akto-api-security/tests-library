# Remediation for GRAPHQL_INTROSPECTION_MODE_ENABLED

## Remediation Steps for GraphQL Introspection Mode Enabled

The Introspection feature in GraphQL is a potential security vulnerability as it allows users to see the API's schema, including all types and their fields. If not properly protected, an attacker can see what operations are available on the server.

### Step 1: Disable Introspection in Production Mode

You can disable introspection queries by adding a simple validation rule to GraphQL server. Here is an example using JavaScript with Apollo Server:

```javascript
import { ApolloServer, gql, ValidationContext, NoSchemaIntrospectionCustomRule } from 'apollo-server';

const server = new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
  introspection: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development',
  validationRules: [NoSchemaIntrospectionCustomRule],
});

server.listen().then(({ url }) => {
  console.log(`ðŸš€  Server ready at ${url}`);
});
```

In this code, introspection is only allowed when development mode is enabled. 

### Step 2: Environment Variable Configuration 

Set your server's `NODE_ENV` to `production` to turn off introspection in a production environment. This can usually be done in your server configuration or environment variable file.

```bash
export NODE_ENV=production
```
