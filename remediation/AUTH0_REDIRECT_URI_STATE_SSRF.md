# Remediation for AUTH0_REDIRECT_URI_STATE_SSRF

## Remediation Steps for SSRF test for Redirect URI with State Parameter in Auth0 Authentication

Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)  is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to induce the server-side application to make HTTP requests to an arbitrary domain of the attacker's choosing. In Auth0 Authentication issues related to the redirect URI with State Parameter can lead to SSRF. It's vital to validate the redirection data rigorously.

### Step 1: Parameter Validation

Ensure that the State Parameter is strictly validated and sanitized before being included in an HTTP request.

### Step 2: Limit HTTP methods

If applicable, ensure the server only supports safe HTTP methods (GET, POST) to minimize the risk.

### Step 3: Use allow-list for IPs/Domains

Create an allowlist of safe domains/IP addresses and ensure the server only redirects to known safe locations.

```javascript
var url = require("url");
var safe_list = ['localhost', 'example.com']; // substitute with your safe list

app.get('/redirect', function(req, res) {
  var target = req.query.target;

  var parsed = url.parse(target);

  if (safe_list.indexOf(parsed.hostname) === -1) {
    res.status(400).send('Invalid target');
  }
  else {
    res.redirect(target);
  }
});
```

### Step 4: Regular Monitoring and Update

Monitor logs regularly and update your safe-list and security measures to respond to detected threats.

Remember to also educate your team about this concern and include it in your Code Review checklist to ensure code merges do not bypass these security measures.

Note: SSRF is a severe and complex security flaw. Remediation steps may vary depending on your specific use case. If unsure, consider engaging a security professional. It is also essential to keep all involved software components up to date and adopt secure coding principles. 

Always perform regular security reviews and use vulnerability scanning tools to help identify any potential threats in your applications.
