# Remediation for PHPFUSION_RCE

## Remediation Steps for PHP-Fusion Remote Code Execution

PHP-Fusion Remote Code Execution is a serious security issue. Without properly securing your PHP-Fusion application, attackers may potentially execute malicious code on your server. 

### Step 1: Update to the latest version of PHP-Fusion

The first step to mitigate this issue is to ensure you are running the latest version of PHP-Fusion, which possesses the fix for this vulnerability. You can download the latest version from PHP-Fusion's official website.

```bash
wget https://downloads.php-fusion.co.uk/PHP-Fusion%209.03.50.zip
unzip PHP-Fusion\ 9.03.50.zip -d /path/to/your/site
```

> Replace `/path/to/your/site` with the actual path where your PHP-Fusion website is hosted.

### Step 2: Check the Code for Dangerous Functions

Scan your PHP code for potentially dangerous functions such as `eval()`, `exec()`, `passthru()`, `shell_exec()`, `system()` etc. Replace them with safer alternatives or limit their usage to only trusted sources. 

For example, replace the `eval()` function

```php
eval($code);
```

with `preg_replace_callback()`

```php
preg_replace_callback(...);
```

### Step 3: Limit User Inputs and Apply Input Filtering

Ensure that all user inputs are checked for any code injection attempts using input filtering functions.

```php
$clean_input = filter_input(INPUT_GET, 'data', FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING);
```
This will help in filtering and sanitizing the data entered by the user.
