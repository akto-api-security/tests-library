## Remediation Steps for BOLA in Old API Versions
Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA) is a common vulnerability that can lead to unauthorized access of sensitive data. By exploiting BOLA, an attacker can access other usersâ€™ resources using the presented ID.

### Step 1: Implement Authorization
Implement access control lists (ACLs) or a similar method for authorizing incoming requests.

```python
def authorize(user_id, object_id):
    authorized_objects = get_authorized_objects(user_id)
    if object_id not in authorized_objects:
        raise NotAuthorizedException()
    return
```

### Step 2: Use Parameterized Queries
Prevent direct object reference by avoiding the usage of object IDs in the URL. Use parameterized queries or secured tokens to refer to actual database IDs.

```php
$stmt = $pdo->prepare('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = :id');
$stmt->execute(['id' => $id]);
```

### Step 3: API Versioning
Introduce versioning to your APIs. Avoid breaking changes in old API versions by maintaining different versions of the API.

```javascript
app.use('/api/v1', require('./v1'));
app.use('/api/v2', require('./v2'));
```
