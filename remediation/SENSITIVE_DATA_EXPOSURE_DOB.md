## Remediation Steps for Sensitive Data Exposure - DOB

Sensitive data exposure of DOB (Date of Birth) is a security issue that could potentially lead to identity theft if not properly taken care of. Encrypting such sensitive data is the best practical solution to this problem.

### Step 1: Encrypt Sensitive Data
Use a strong encryption standard such as AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) to encrypt the sensitive data before storing it.

Here's an example of how this can be done with Python's `pycryptodome` library:

```python
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
from base64 import b64encode, b64decode

def encrypt_data(data, key):
    cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_EAX)
    nonce = cipher.nonce
    ciphertext, _ = cipher.encrypt_and_digest(data.encode('utf-8'))
    encrypted_data = b64encode(ciphertext).decode('utf-8')
    return encrypted_data

def decrypt_data(ciphertext, key):
    ciphertext = b64decode(ciphertext)
    cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_EAX, nonce=nonce)
    plaintext = cipher.decrypt(ciphertext).decode('utf-8')
    return plaintext
```

### Step 2: Secure Data Transmission
Use HTTPS protocol when transmitting the data between the client and server. HTTPS encrypts your data in transit and better protects against threats such as man-in-the-middle attacks. 

### Step 3: Limit Data Exposure
Limit the exposure of DOB and other sensitive data by not sending it in non-required API requests/responses. Have strong access controls and always validate user roles and rights before allowing access to sensitive data.
