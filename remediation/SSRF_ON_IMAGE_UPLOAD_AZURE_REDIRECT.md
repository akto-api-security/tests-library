## Remediation Steps for Sensitive Azure Details Exposure
Sensitive Azure details exposure through Image param replacement with redirection due to Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) is of great concern. 
 
### Step 1: Block Redirection
One of the preventive security measures to handle this kind of threat is to block unnecessary redirections. Make sure your application should only allow safe redirects:

```python
def safe_redirect(request, url):
    url_host = urlparse(url).netloc

    # Avoid external redirects
    if not url_host or url_host == request.get_host():
        return redirect(url)
    
    # Block any unsafe redirection
    else:
        raise ValueError('Unsafe redirect to %s ignored.' % url)
```
    
### Step 2: Prevent SSRF Attacks
Prevent SSRF attacks by check that every server-side call to an external service is to a 'known' and 'approved' service and prevent any invocation to a URL that's not explicitly whitelisted:

```python
WHITELIST_URLS = ['URL1', 'URL2', 'URL3']

def prevent_ssrf(url):
    url_host = urlparse(url).netloc

    if url_host not in WHITELIST_URLS:
        raise ValueError('Disallowed external service: %s' % url)
```
    
### Step 3: Hide Azure Sensitive Details
Keep all Azure sensitive information in environment variables. This will prevent such critical data from exposure:

```python
import os

AZURE_KEY = os.environ.get("AZURE_KEY")
```
