## Remediation Steps for Overreliance test on Lightweight Local Manager (LLMs) - Generating Full Malware with ARM64

Relying too much on LLMs and not properly securing systems can leave a system vulnerable to ARM64 Full Malware generation. 

Here are steps that can be taken to mitigate this security issue:

### Step 1: Use Stronger and More Diverse Security Measures.

In addition to using LLMs, implement different security measures. Consider using real-time threat detection, penetration testing, and regular system audits.

```python
def apply_additional_security_measures():
    apply_real_time_threat_detection()
    conduct_regular_penetration_testing()
    perform_regular_system_audits()
```
### Step 2: Regularly Update and Patch System Vulnerabilities

Regularly updating and patching your system can prevent the exploitation of known security vulnerabilities.

```python
def update_and_patch_system():
    check_for_updates()
    if updates_available:
        apply_updates()
    check_for_patches()
    if patches_available:
        apply_patches()
```

### Step 3: Harden Interfaces Between Infrastructure Components

Interfaces between infrastructure components should be hardened to reduce the size of attack surface.

```python
def harden_interfaces():
    for interface in interfaces:
        if interface.is_not_secured():
            interface.harden()
```

### Step 4: Ensure LLMs have the Correct Permissions

Verify how your lightweight local managers (LLMs) are configured. Use the least privilege principle. Only assign necessary permissions to users, applications, and processes.

```python
def configure_llms():
    for llm in llms:
        if llm.has_excessive_privileges():
            llm.limit_privileges()
```

### Step 5: Use an Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

Using an intrusion detection system can help detect any potential threats or attacks and respond quickly.

```python
def use_intrusion_detection_system():
    if not ids.is_active():
        ids.activate()
```

Please bear in mind that the provided pythonlike pseudo code can not be run directly, as the exact implementation heavily depends on your infrastructure and chosen technologies.
