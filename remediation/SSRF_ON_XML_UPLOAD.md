# Remediation for SSRF_ON_XML_UPLOAD

## Remediation Steps for AWS Sensitive Details Exposure via XML param replacement due to SSRF

Exposure of sensitive AWS details through XML parameter replacement due to SSRF (Server Side Request Forgery) is a very serious security vulnerability. In such a scenario, an attacker may manipulate the server using crafted requests and gain unauthorized access to critical cloud resources.

### Step 1: Avoid Using XML with Untrusted Data

XML is inherently vulnerable to multiple types of attacks like injection attacks, and thus it's recommended to use simpler formats like JSON, if possible.

### Step 2: Use a Whitelist of Approved Domains

Create a whitelist of trusted domains and only allow server-to-server interactions with those tools. Below is an example in Python.

```python
WHITELIST = ['http://trusted.com', 'http://allowed.com']

def validate_url(url):
    if url.startswith(tuple(WHITELIST)):
        return True
    return False
```

### Step 3: Implement a Server-Side Proxy

A proxy server can be used which will perform any server-to-server requests. The proxy server can be locked down with firewalls to only necessary ports and servers.

### Step 4: Prevent Defaults AWS Credentials Discovery

```bash
unset AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY AWS_SESSION_TOKEN
```

### Step 5: Regular Audit and Update

Conduct regular audits of your server logs and keep all your systems updated with the latest patches and updates from the vendor.

### Step 6: AWS IAM Roles

Use AWS IAM Roles assigned to EC2 instances instead of hardcoding credentials in your application.

### Step 7: Firewall Configuration

```bash
iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j DROP
iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --dport 443 -j DROP
```
Block outbound traffic except for trusted domains to avoid sending requests to the internal ips, etc. 

Remember, it's always important to follow best practices for secure coding to prevent such vulnerabilities.
