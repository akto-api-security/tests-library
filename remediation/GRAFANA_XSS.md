## Remediation Steps for Grafana Cross-Site Scripting Issue
Grafana Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue is a security vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. 

### Step 1: Update Grafana Version
The first step to remediate this issue is to update your Grafana to a version where the vulnerability is fixed. This can be completed by running the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade grafana
```

### Step 2: Input Validation
Ensure that validation is applied to all user inputs, and any suspicious or malicious-looking inputs are rejected. This can be implemented in various coding languages. Here is a simple example in JavaScript:

```javascript
function validateInput(userInput) {
    const re = /<(.|\n)*?>/; // regex for HTML tags
    if (re.test(userInput)) {
        throw new Error('Invalid input');
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Implement Content Security Policy
A Content Security Policy (CSP) can be used to limit the number of places a browser can load JavaScript from. This security measure can be done on the server-side and is included via a HTTP response header.

```javascript
app.use(helmet.contentSecurityPolicy({
  directives: {
    defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
    scriptSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'"],
    styleSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'"]
  }
}))
```
