# Remediation for UNION_COLUMN_BASED_SQLI_POST

## Remediation Steps for Union based SQL Injection test with column variations on POST method APIs
Union-based SQL Injection, especially with column variations targeting POST method APIs, is a critical security issue. An attacker may use this exploit to view, modify, or delete records in your database.

### Step 1: Parameterized Queries
Replace in-line SQL queries with parameterized queries or prepared statements to automatically escape harmful meta-characters which could be used in an SQL Injection attack. This gives your database a predefined query to run and ensures the SQL interpreter does not see end-user input as a command.

In PHP, using PDO (PHP Data Objects), the code would be like this:

```php
$stmt = $pdo->prepare('SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = :email AND password = :password');
$stmt->execute(['email' => $email, 'password' => $password]);
```

### Step 2: Limit Database Permissions
Limit the permissions given to the database account used by your application. It should only have the permissions necessary to perform its intended operation.

### Step 3: Input Validation and Sanitization
Add robust validation and sanitization routines to your application, ensuring data is valid for its type and sanitizing it against known harmful characters.

In JavaScript, using express-validator, the code would be like this:

```javascript
const { body } = require('express-validator');

app.post('/user', [
  body('email').isEmail(),
  body('password').isLength({ min: 5 })
], (req, res) => {
  // Your handler
});
```

### Step 4: Web Application Firewall (WAF)
Consider using a WAF, such as ModSecurity, to help filter out malicious input.

### Step 5: Regularly Update and Audit
Regularly update your application and its dependencies to ensure any recently discovered vulnerabilities have been patched. Conducting regular audits can help you detect attempts of SQL Injection.

Remember, security is an ongoing effort and regular audits and code reviews should be conducted to ensure your defenses remain effective as new threats emerge.
