# Remediation for SENSITIVE_DATA_EXPOSURE_FACEBOOK_ACCESS_TOKEN

## Remediation Steps for Sensitive Data Exposure - Facebook Access Token
Sensitive data exposure of Facebook Access Token can lead to serious breaches as it can provide unauthorized access to a user's Facebook data. It is essential to secure these tokens to prevent misuse.

### Step 1: Store tokens securely
Store tokens in secure server-side sessions. Do not transmit them to clients unless absolutely necessary.
```javascript
// Node.js example with express-session
const session = require('express-session');
app.use(session({
  secret: 'your-secret-value',
  saveUninitialized: false,
  resave: false,
  cookie: {
    secure: true, // ensures the cookie is sent over HTTPS
    httpOnly: true // ensures the cookie cannot be accessed through client side script
  }
}));
```

### Step 2: Implement server-side validation 
Implement checks on the server to verify that the token being used matches the one associated with the user's session.
```javascript
app.post('/api/secure', (req, res) => {
  if (req.session.accessToken !== req.body.accessToken) {
    res.status(403).send('Invalid access token');
  } else {
    // Continue with the request
  }
});
```

### Step 3: Use HTTPS
Always transmit access tokens over a secure HTTPS connection.
```javascript
const https = require('https');
// Use HTTPS module to interact with APIs and transmit tokens securely.
```

### Step 4: Limit token permissions
When asking for Facebook permissions, ask for the minimum required permissions. This reduces the impact of a token if it is compromised.

### Step 5: Token Expiration
Facebook access tokens should be short-lived with expiration times. Make sure to implement token refresh mechanisms.

### Step 6: Regular Audit and Update
Audit your application regularly for any security vulnerabilities and apply updates accordingly. Keep the access tokens dynamic and change them periodically, and expire the old tokens.
