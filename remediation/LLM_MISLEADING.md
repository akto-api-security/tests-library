# Remediation for LLM_MISLEADING

## Remediation Steps for Overreliance on LLMs - Misleading Claims
Overreliance on live location models (LLMs) can lead to misleading claims which may compromise the authenticity and reliability of applications. This poses a great risk, especially for applications that depend on location data for their operations.

### Step 1: Verify Source of Data
Always ensure that the LLM data being used is from a reliable and trusted source.
```python
def validate_source(source):
    if source != trusted_source:
        raise Exception('Data source not trustworthy')
```

### Step 2: Use Multiple Models
Avoid relying solely on LLMs. Incorporate external audits to correct any misleading claims.
```python
def use_multiple_models():
    location_data = LLM_data if LLM_data.is_trustworthy else alternative_data
```
