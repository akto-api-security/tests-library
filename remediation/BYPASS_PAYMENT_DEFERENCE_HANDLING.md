# Remediation for BYPASS_PAYMENT_DEFERENCE_HANDLING

## Remediation Steps for Bypass Payment Deference Handling

Bypass Payment Deference Handling is a critical vulnerability. Attackers using this exploit can skip the payment process and get unauthorized access to paid contents or services. Follow these steps to remediate this issue:

### Step 1: Validate User Input
Ensure that all user inputs are validated using a server-side script. For instance, in PHP you can do this:

```php
<?php
  $quantity = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $_POST['quantity']);
  $product_id = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $_POST['product_id']);
  
  if (!preg_match('/^[0-9]+$/', $quantity) || !preg_match('/^[0-9]+$/', $product_id)) {
    die("Invalid input");
  }
?>
```

### Step 2: Implement Server-side Price Verification

Don't rely on client-side price calculation. Always have a server-side price verification before processing the payment. You can do a second check on the server side, like this:

```php
<?php
  // After validating the inputs
  $server_price = $quantity * $product_price;
  if ($server_price !== $client_price) {
    die("Price mismatch");
  }
?>
```

### Step 3: Implement Secure Payment Gateway

Use a secure and reliable Payment Gateway API which handles payments securely and can't be bypassed easily. 

```java
public class PaymentService {
    
    private PaymentGateway paymentGateway;
    
    public Response makePayment(Order order, PaymentInfo paymentInfo) {
        boolean isValid = paymentGateway.validatePayment(order, paymentInfo);
        if (!isValid) {
            // Send error response
            return Response.status(Status.UNAUTHORIZED).build();
        }
        // Execute payment and send success response
        paymentGateway.executePayment(order, paymentInfo);
        return Response.status(Status.OK).build();
    }
}
```
