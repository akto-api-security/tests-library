## Remediation Steps for Command Injection via Query Parameters
Command injection via query parameters is a common security vulnerability. If not properly mitigated, an attacker could execute arbitrary commands on the server.

### Step 1: Parameterized Queries 
Ensure every database query that includes parameters from an HTTP request is parameterized. This means that the query is compiled first with placeholder parameters, and only then are those parameters substituted into the query. 

An example in **Python** using **MySQL**:

```python
import mysql.connector

# Connecting to the database
cnx = mysql.connector.connect(user='myuser', database='mydatabase')

# Creating a cursor for SQL commands
cursor = cnx.cursor()

# Preparing a parameterized query
query = "SELECT * FROM mytable WHERE id = %s"
value = (user_input,) # user_input is the variable containing possibly unsafe data

cursor.execute(query, value)
```
### Step 2: Validate Input
All user inputs, especially those incorporated into system or database commands, must be validated to ensure they won't misbehave. A simple method of validation may consist of only letting alphanumeric characters. 

Here is a basic example of input validation in **Python**:

```python
import re

# user_input is the variable containing possibly unsafe data
if not re.match("^[a-zA-Z0-9]*$", user_input):
    print("Invalid input")
```

### Step 3: Use of Safest APIs
In some languages, some API functions are safer than others. Try to replace unsafe functions with safer alternatives where possible.

For example, in **PHP**, consider using `mysqli::real_escape_string()` to escape special characters in a string:

```php
$mysqli = new mysqli('localhost', 'myuser', 'mypassword', 'mydb');
$unsafe_variable = $_POST['user_input'];
$safe_variable = $mysqli->real_escape_string($unsafe_variable);
$query = sprintf("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id='%s'", $safe_variable);
```

### Step 4: Least Privilege Principle
The principle of least privilege (POLP) implies giving an account or process the bare minimum privileges it needs to perform its intended function. For database accounts, this could mean limiting the types of queries the account can run.
