# Remediation for APACHE_HTTP_SERVER_ACL_BYPASS

## Remediation Steps for Apache HTTP Server ACL Bypass Test

Apache HTTP server ACL bypass is a critical security risks, where an attacker could potentially bypass access controls and gain unauthorized access to protected resources. Hence, it is crucial to fix this issue.

The remediation steps involve the proper configuration of Apache's access control directives.

### Step 1: Edit Apache Configuration File

You need to gain access to the Apache configuration file (`httpd.conf` or `apache2.conf`). For Unix-based systems, you can usually find this in `/etc/httpd` or `/etc/apache2`.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
```

### Step 2: Configure Access Control Directives

Depending on your need, configure the `Require`, `Order`, `Allow`, `Deny` directives.

For example, for restricting access to all IP addresses except for a specific one, add the following block inside the `<Directory>` directives:

```apacheconf
<Directory /var/www/>
    # ...existing configuration...
    Require all denied
    Require ip 123.123.123.123
</Directory>
```

Replace "123.123.123.123" with your own IP address.

### Step 3: Save and Exit

After finishing your edits, save and close the file.

### Step 4: Test Configuration

Before restarting Apache, check that your configuration changes are correct with the following command:

```bash
sudo apachectl configtest
```

If you don't see any error messages, your configuration changes are correct.

### Step 5: Restart Apache Server

Lastly, it's important to restart Apache to apply changes:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart httpd
```

or

```bash
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```
