# Remediation for SQL_INJECTION_REFERER_HEADER

## Remediation Steps for SQL Injection Test on Referer Header
SQL Injection in headers is a severe security issue that could allow an attacker to manipulate or exploit your database. SQL Injection can happen if you directly use data from the header in a SQL query.

### Step 1:  Input Validation
Avoid using user-provided input directly in a SQL query. If required, you should use parameterized queries or prepared statements.

**Python with Psycopg2 Example**
```python
cur = conn.cursor()
cur.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = %s", (username,))
```

**Java with JDBC Example**
```java
String selectSQL = "SELECT * FROM USER WHERE USERNAME = ?";
PreparedStatement preparedStatement = dbConnection.prepareStatement(selectSQL);
preparedStatement.setString(1, username);
ResultSet rs = preparedStatement.executeQuery(selectSQL );
```
### Step 2: Database User Permissions
Limit database permissions for directory browsing or execution of certain stored procedures.

### Step 3: Regular Patching and Updating
Ensure you're consistently applying patches to your DBMS software, as well as any associated applications that directly access it.

### Step 4: Web Application Firewall (WAF)
A web application firewall (WAF) can help mitigate SQL Injection attacks. This software application filters, monitors, and blocks HTTP/HTTPS traffic to and from a web application.

### Step 5: Use a Secure Development Lifecycle
Ensure that you introduce security early in your development cycle. Include practices such as threat modeling, secure code review, and penetration testing.

### Step 6: Regular Auditing and Monitoring
On a regular basis, conduct an application audit and maintain security incident logs. By doing so, you can track and assess new threats and vulnerabilities that emerge. Be sure to engage with security alerts and updates specific to your tech stack.
