# Remediation for ADVANCED_UNION_BASED_SQLI_POST

## Remediation Steps for Advanced Union Based SQL Injection

Advanced Union Based SQL Injection is a critical security issue. If not properly secured, an attacker may exploit this vulnerability to access, modify, or delete your database data.

### Step 1: Sanitize User Input 

Make sure to sanitize all user inputs before using them in SQL queries. Never trust user data blindly. In PHP, you can use prepared statements and parameterized queries with PDO (PHP Data Objects) or MySQLi.

```php
<?php
$servername = "localhost";
$username = "username";
$password = "password";
$dbname = "myDBPDO";

try {
  $conn = new PDO("mysql:host=$servername;dbname=$dbname", $username, $password);
  $conn->setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE, PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION);

  $stmt = $conn->prepare("SELECT firstname, lastname FROM Users WHERE userid = :userid");
  $stmt->bindParam(':userid', $userid);

  $userid = 6;
  $stmt->execute();

  // set the resulting array to associative
  $result = $stmt->setFetchMode(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);
} catch(PDOException $e) {
  echo "Error: " . $e->getMessage();
}
$conn = null;
?>
```

### Step 2: Use Appropriate Firewall Rules

Limit the number of requests from a single IP address per unit of time to prevent SQL Injection attacks.

### Step 3: Regular Database Audit and Updates

Regularly check and update your databases to the latest stable version to avoid being vulnerable to known exploits.

### Step 4: Use Web Application Firewall

Use a web application firewall (WAF) which can help to filter out SQL Injection attacks.

### Step 5: Limit Database Permissions

Limit the permissions of database accounts used by web applications. There is no need for these accounts to have administrative permissions.

Remember: Prevention is the key. Secure coding practices and regular audits can go a long way in securing your applications.
