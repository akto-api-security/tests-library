# Remediation for AUTH0_REDIRECT_URI_LOCALHOST_SSRF

## Remediation Steps for SSRF test with Localhost URLs for Redirect URI Parameter in Auth0 Authentication 

Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerabilities can cause serious issues by allowing attackers to interact with internal network services, read files or launch attacks from your servers. When misconfigurations or inappropriate settings in Auth0's Redirect URI parameter occur, SSRF vulnerabilities could be exploited.

### Step 1: Input Validation 
Implement strict input validation for the URL to be used in the Redirect URI. This should reject any request that does not meet the intended format or structure. 

```javascript
const validateURL = (url) => {
    const pattern = /^https?:\/\/[a-z0-9]+([\-\.]{1}[a-z0-9]+)*\.[a-z]{2,5}(:[0-9]{1,5})?(\/.*)?$/i;
    if(!pattern.test(url)){
        throw new Error('Invalid URL');
    } else {
        return url;
    }
}
```
### Step 2: Whitelist Hosts
Restrict the range of IP addresses or hosts that the Redirect URI parameter can call out to. This should not include any internal IP addresses or "localhost".

```javascript
const whitelistURLs = ["https://example.com", "https://example2.com"]; // Enter your Whitelist urls
const getHostname = (url) => {
    return new URL(url).hostname;
}
const isWhitelisted = (url) => {
    return whitelistURLs.includes(getHostname(url));
}
```
### Step 3: Regular Audit of Redirect URIs
Review the Redirect URIs in your Auth0 applications on a regular basis. Remove any that are no longer needed to minimize the attack surface.

Unfortunately, Auth0 does not provide an automated method or tool to do this, so you need to manually check it on the dashboard or periodically use the Management API to get a list of all applications and their Redirect URIs. 

_This remediation assumes an understanding of programming concepts and practices, and edits should only be made by experienced programmers due to the potential negative impact on application functionality._
