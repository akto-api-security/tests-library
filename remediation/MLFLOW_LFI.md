## Remediation Steps for MLFlow Local File Inclusion
MLFlow Local File Inclusion is a security vulnerability that happens when an attacker has the ability to read files that they should not be able to read on the server through the MLFlow.

The remediation steps for this issue include improving input validation and sanitization to prevent malicious file paths, upgrading the vulnerable components and restricting file permissions.

### Step 1: Improve Input Validation and Sanitization
Improve input validation and sanitization in your MLFlow implementation. Do not trust user input and make sure it is properly sanitized to avoid attempts at directory traversal.

Here is an example of how input can be validated using Python:
```python
import os

def validate_path(path):
    return os.path.join('BASE_PATH', os.path.normpath(path).lstrip('/'))

input_path = '../etc/passwd'    # This is an example risky input
safe_path = validate_path(input_path)
```
### Step 2: Upgrade Vulnerable Components
This issue has been fixed in MLFlow 1.12.1. If you are running a vulnerable MLFlow version, please upgrade to the latest version.
```bash
pip install --upgrade mlflow
```
### Step 3: Restrict File Permissions
Restrict the file permissions of sensitive files on your server to prevent unauthorized access. This can be done using the chmod command for Unix systems.
```bash
chmod 600 sensitive_file
```
