# Remediation for LLM_MALWARE_SUBFUNCTION_ARM64

## Remediation Steps for Overreliance on LLMs - Generating Malware Subfunctions with ARM64

Overreliance on Low-Level Microarchitectural features (LLMs) when generating Malware Subfunctions with ARM64 can lead to security issues. If there is an overreliance on such features, it might inadvertently allow an attacker to exploit or infiltrate the system. Hence, it is crucial to use high-level defenses to secure the system.

### Step 1: Limit Inline assembly

Inline assembly makes it difficult for security tools to analyze the binary. Therefore, you should use it sparingly or avoid it entirely.

```cpp
// avoid
int main() {
    asm("MOV R0, #7");
}
// prefer
int main() {
    int x = 7;
}
```

### Step 2: Enable Compiler Security Features

Let your compiler help you with security by enabling security features like `-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2` and `-fstack-protector-strong`.

```bash
gcc -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 -fstack-protector-strong program.c -o program
```

### Step 3: Regular Security Audits

While developing the code, perform regular security audits to find and fix potential weaknesses.

```bash
# Example using Flawfinder
flawfinder /path/to/source/code
```

### Step 4: Avoid Unauthorized Memory Access

Make sure you are not allowing unauthorized access to memory.

```cpp
// avoid
int *ptr = NULL;
*ptr = 4; // Bad! This is a null pointer dereference.

// prefer
int x = 4;
int *ptr = &x;
```

### Step 5: Use Static Analysis Tools

Utilize static code analysis tools to catch potential security vulnerabilities early in the development process. Many modern IDE's come with this feature baked in; use it to your advantage.

```bash
# Example using PVS-Studio
pvs-studio-analyzer analyze -l ~/pvs.lic -o ~/project.log
```

Please note that these steps are merely a starting point. Real security comes from continual awareness and effort at all stages of software development.
