## Remediation Steps for Overreliance on LLMs - Generating Malware Subfunctions with ARM64

Overreliance on Low-Level Microarchitectural features (LLMs) when generating Malware Subfunctions with ARM64 can lead to security issues. If there is an overreliance on such features, it might inadvertently allow an attacker to exploit or infiltrate the system. Hence, it is crucial to use high-level defenses to secure the system.

### Step 1: Limit Inline assembly

Inline assembly makes it difficult for security tools to analyze the binary. Therefore, you should use it sparingly or avoid it entirely.

```cpp
// avoid
int main() {
    asm("MOV R0, #7");
}
// prefer
int main() {
    int x = 7;
}
```


### Step 2: Avoid Unauthorized Memory Access

Make sure you are not allowing unauthorized access to memory.

```cpp
// avoid
int *ptr = NULL;
*ptr = 4; // Bad! This is a null pointer dereference.

// prefer
int x = 4;
int *ptr = &x;
```
