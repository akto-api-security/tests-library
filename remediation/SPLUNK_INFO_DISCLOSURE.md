## Remediation Steps for Splunk Information Disclosure

Splunk Information Disclosure can occur when sensitive data, such as log files or network traffic, is unintentionally exposed. This kind of vulnerability might allow an attacker to obtain valuable information about your system.

### Step 1: Configure Internal Logging

To mitigate the information disclosure of Splunk, you should configure the internal logging to exclude sensitive data. This will prevent plain text passwords from being stored in internal log files.

```bash
# in inputs.conf
[monitor:///var/log/...]
blacklist = password
```

### Step 2: Limit Indexing Of Sensitive Data

You have to limit the indexing of sensitive data to help prevent this data from being searchable in Splunk.

```bash
# in props.conf
[source::...password...]
TRANSFORMS-null= setnull

# in transforms.conf
[setnull]
REGEX = .
DEST_KEY = queue
FORMAT = nullQueue
```

### Step 3: Limit Access Control
Appropriate permissions and data access should be enforced to secure the data from unauthorized access.

```bash
# in authentication.conf
[role_admin]
srchIndexesAllowed = main;os;_audit
srchIndexesDefault = main;os;_audit
```

### Step 4: Use of SSL

Ensure secure communication by using SSL for data transmission in Splunk to prevent sensitive information from being intercepted during transit.

```bash
# command in server.conf to enable SSL
[sslConfig]
useSplunkdClientSSL = true
```
