# Remediation for AWS_OPENSEARCH_LOGIN_PAGE_EXPOSURE

## Remediation Steps for AWS OpenSearch Login Page Exposure

Exposing AWS OpenSearch login page to the internet could be a potential security threat. This could potentially give attackers unauthorized access to sensitive data. Follow the steps below to remediate the issue and secure your AWS OpenSearch service.

### Step 1: Configure an Access Policy 

Create a secure access policy to allow only specific IP addresses or IAM users. 

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::account-id:user/username"
      },
      "Action": "es:*",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:es:us-east-1:account-id:domain/domain-name/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

Replace "account-id" with your AWS account ID and "username" with your IAM user name. Replace "us-east-1" with your AWS region and "domain-name" with your OpenSearch domain name.

### Step 2 - Configure Network settings

Control access to your domain with the OpenSearch Service VPC. 

### Step 3: Use HTTPS Only

Disable the http and use https for secure communication. 

### Step 4: Enable Audit Logs

Audit logs provide visibility into the OpenSearch operations, and could be used for security analysis.

```bash
aws es update-elasticsearch-domain-config --domain-name my-domain --audit-log-options Enabled=true
```

Replace "my-domain" with your OpenSearch domain name.

### Step 5: Regularly Audit and Update

Regularly review and update your access policy and settings to ensure it meets your current needs.

Remember, keeping your login page private is crucial to system security, therefore avoid any exposure to the internet.
