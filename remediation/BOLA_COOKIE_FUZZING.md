# Remediation for BOLA_COOKIE_FUZZING

## Remediation Steps for Fuzzing Cookie Data: Exploiting BOLA for Unauthorized Access

Fuzzing Cookie Data and exploiting BOLA (Broken Object Level Authorization) can lead to unauthorized access. This security issue can permit attackers to gain access and manipulate users' data.

The following uses Python/Flask for example implementation:

### Step 1: Implement Server-Side Input Validation and Sanitization

Always apply validation and sanitization on server-side to ensure the safety of input data.

```python
from flask import request
from wtforms import Form, BooleanField, StringField, validators

class RegistrationForm(Form):
    username = StringField('Username', [validators.Length(min=4, max=25)])

@app.route('/api', methods=['POST'])
def login():
    form = RegistrationForm(request.form)
    if request.method == 'POST' and form.validate():
        user = User(form.username.data)
        if user.is_authenticated():
            login_user(user)
    else:
        abort(400)
```

### Step 2: Apply Secure and HttpOnly Cookie Flags

Using Secure and HttpOnly flags makes cookies to be only sent over HTTPS and prevents access by client side scripts, providing an additional layer of protection.

```python
from flask import Flask, session

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.after_request
def apply_caching(response):
   response.headers["Set-Cookie"] = "secure; httponly"
   return response
```

### Step 3: Implement Proper BOLA Protection

Implement protections against BOLA, like ensuring the object's owner or an admin user is the one trying to access the object.

```python
@app.route('/api/user/<user_id>', methods=['GET'])
@login_required
def get_user(user_id):
    user = User.query.get(user_id)
    if user != g.user and not g.user.is_admin:
        abort(403)
    return jsonify(user.to_dict())
```
