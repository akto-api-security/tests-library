# Remediation for MANIPULATING_ACCESS_LEVELS

## Remediation Steps for Manipulating Access Levels in Resource Consumption APIs
Manipulating Access Levels in Resource Consumption APIs is a critical security vulnerability that can expose sensitive data or allow unauthorized operations to be performed. Proper measures should be taken to correct this issue.

### Step 1: Ensure Proper Authorization 
Ensure that each API operation requires proper authorization that corresponds to the user's access level. All requests to the API should be verified for permissions. If you're using Node.js express framework and a middleware for authorization such as 'express-jwt', you can use the following code:

```javascript
    var express = require('express');
    var jwt = require('express-jwt');

    var app = express();

    // Middleware for checking jwt
    app.use(jwt({ secret: 'your_secret_key'}));

    // Only accessible for authenticated users
    app.get('/api/resource', function(req, res) {
        res.send('Hello, ' + req.user.name);
    });
```

### Step 2: Implement Access Control
Depending on the user's access level, restrict what resources the user can interact with. This can be achieved by implementing Access Control Lists (ACL). Here is a general example of how you can use ACLs:

```javascript
    var acl = new node_acl(new node_acl.memoryBackend());

    // guest is allowed to view blogs
    acl.allow('guest', 'blog', 'view')

    // check if the user has permission to view the blog
    acl.isAllowed('username', 'blog', 'view', function(err, res){
        if(res){
            console.log("User is allowed to view the blog");
        }
    });
```

### Step 3: Regularly Update and Audit
Regularly update the access control mechanisms to ensure they're adequate for the current user roles and permissions. Also, perform regular security audits.

```bash
    # Restart the server
    sudo service api-server restart
```

### Step 4: Error Handling 
Proper error handling should be implemented to prevent revealing sensitive information.
```javascript
    app.use(function (err, req, res, next) {
        if (err.name === 'UnauthorizedError') {
            res.status(401).send('Invalid token');
        }
    });
```
