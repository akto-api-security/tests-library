# Remediation for REMOVE_CAPTCHA

## Remediation Steps for Removing Captcha from Request

Removing captcha from request can lead to several security vulnerabilities such as bot spamming, DDoS attacks, and brute-force attacks. To fix this security issue, re-add the captcha to the form by following these instructions.

### Step 1: Add back Captcha in HTML Form
Add the Captcha field back into your HTML form. Here's an example with Google's reCAPTCHA.

```html
<form method="post" action="someURL">
    <!-- other input fields -->
    <div class="g-recaptcha" data-sitekey="your-site-key"></div>
    <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
<script src='https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api.js'></script>
```

Your site key will be provided by reCAPTCHA during the setup process.

### Step 2: Validate Captcha in Server-Side Code

Remember, you also need to check the captcha responses server-side, as client-side checks can be bypassed. Here's an example in Python using Flask and the 'requests' library.

```python
import requests
from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)
RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY = 'your-secret-key'

@app.route('/submit', methods=['POST'])
def submit():
    captcha_response = request.form.get('g-recaptcha-response')

    if is_human(captcha_response):
        # process the form
        pass
    else:
        # return error message
        pass

def is_human(captcha_response):
    payload = {'response': captcha_response, 'secret': RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY}
    response = requests.post('https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api/siteverify', payload)

    return response.json()['success']
```

The server must validate the user's captcha response with the reCAPTCHA API. Remember to replace 'your-secret-key' with your reCAPTCHA secret key.

### Step 3: Regular Updates and Audits

Keep your Captcha system regularly updated and perform audits to avoid any exploitation of potential vulnerabilities. It's important to realize that while Captcha adds an essential layer of protection, one must also implement other security measures to safeguard data and protect against attacks.
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
```
