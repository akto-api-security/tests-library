## Remediation Steps for Denial of Service (DoS) via Large PDF File URL

Denial of Service (DoS) via a large PDF file URL can potentially lead to server overload, resulting in service unavailability. Below are three steps to help remediate this issue using input validation and throttling in Python.

### Step 1: Input Validation

Implement input validation on all user-supplied URLs to ensure they are safe and valid. Input validation could involve checking the URL's domain, path, and/or filetype.

```python
import validators

def validate_url(url):
    if validators.url(url) and url.endswith('.pdf'):
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

### Step 2: Implement File Size Threshold

By checking the file size before fetching the file, we can mitigate the DOS risk. Below is a Python function that checks the size of a file before fetching it.

```python
import requests

def fetch_file(url):
    response = requests.head(url, allow_redirects = True)
    file_size = int(response.headers.get('content-length', 0))

    # exit if size exceeds threshold (100 MB in this example)
    if file_size > 1e8:
        print("File is too large. Aborting fetch.")
        return None
    else:
        # Download the file
        response = requests.get(url)
        return response.content
```

### Step 3: Rate Limiting

By implementing rate limiting, you can add another layer of protection against DoS attacks. A user can only make a certain number of requests within a specified time period. 

A common Python library for this is `Flask-Limiter`.

```python
from flask_limiter import Limiter
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)
limiter = Limiter(app, key_func=get_remote_address)

@app.route("/")
@limiter.limit("10/minute")  # adjust rate limit as needed
def fetch_file():
    # fetch file code goes here
    pass
```

These measures combined will significantly increase your application's resilience against DoS attacks via large PDF file URLs.
