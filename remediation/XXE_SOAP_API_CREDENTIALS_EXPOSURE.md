# Remediation for XXE_SOAP_API_CREDENTIALS_EXPOSURE

## Remediation Steps for XML External Entity (XXE) Exploit in SOAP API for Credentials Exposure

XML External Entity (XXE) injection is a serious security vulnerability where an attacker can interfere with the processing of XML data by an application. This can lead to confidential information disclosure, denial of service, and remote code execution.

__NOTE__: The solution provided uses Java programming language as its choice. Also, it assumes you are using a parser that is vulnerable to XXE Injection.

### Step 1: Disable DTD (Document Type Definition)

The first step is to disable DTDs, as they open a potential attack vector for XXE.

 ```java
 DocumentBuilderFactory dbf = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();
 dbf.setFeature("http://apache.org/xml/features/disallow-doctype-decl", true);
 ```

### Step 2: Disable External Entities

We must also disable external entities in the XML Parser since they can be exploited for attacks.

```java
dbf.setFeature("http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities", false);
dbf.setFeature("http://xml.org/sax/features/external-parameter-entities", false);
dbf.setFeature("http://apache.org/xml/features/nonvalidating/load-external-dtd", false);
```

### Step 3: Test the configuration

Ensure that configuration changes have taken effect and that the system is no longer vulnerable to XXE attacks. Test it with unit tests, security-based tests, and QA.
