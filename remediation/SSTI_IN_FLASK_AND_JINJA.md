# Remediation for SSTI_IN_FLASK_AND_JINJA

## Remediation Steps for Server-side Template Injection (SSTI) in Flask and Jinja
Server-side Template Injection (SSTI) in Flask and Jinja can allow an attacker to inject malicious code into your server, which can lead to serious consequences if not properly addressed.

### Step 1: Disable Flask Debug Mode
Flask's default configuration may leave debug mode enabled. When debug mode is on, a SSTI attack can lead to arbitrary code execution. Turn it off and only enable in a secure manner when necessary.
```python
app.debug = False
```

### Step 2: Use Autoescaping in Jinja
Jinja provides a feature called autoescaping that helps prevent SSTI. It's turned off by default in Flask, so make sure to turn it on.
```python
from jinja2 import Environment, select_autoescape
env = Environment(autoescape(select_autoescape(['html', 'xml'])))
```

### Step 3: Sanitize Input 
Always sanitize user-provided input before passing it to any functions that load templates. This can be done with the `markupsafe` package.
```python
from markupsafe import escape

@app.route('/example', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def example():
  query = escape(request.form['user_input'])

  template = env.get_template('template.html')
  return template.render(query=query)
```

### Step 4: Validate Input 
If possible, use server-side validation to ensure any input matches expected patterns.

### Step 5: Regular Code Review and Update
Regularly reviewing and updating your code can prevent potential vulnerabilities from persisting in your applications.
