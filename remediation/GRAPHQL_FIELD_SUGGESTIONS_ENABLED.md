## Remediation Steps for Graphql Field Suggestions Enabled
The primary risk of enabling Graphql field suggestions is that it may expose potentially sensitive data to malicious or unauthorized users.

### Step 1: Disable Graphql field suggestions
In your GraphQL server setup, determine if Graphql field suggestions are enabled. You may disable them by modifying the server settings. In this example, we use Apollo Server in JavaScript:

```javascript
const server = new ApolloServer({ 
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
  introspection: false, // Disable graphql field suggestions
});
```
### Step 2: Use a production environment configuration
Optionally, to make Graphql field suggestions available in development but not in production, use the `NODE_ENV` variable to manage it. 

```javascript
const server = new ApolloServer({ 
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
  introspection: process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production', 
});
```
