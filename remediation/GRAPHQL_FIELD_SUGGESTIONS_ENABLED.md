# Remediation for GRAPHQL_FIELD_SUGGESTIONS_ENABLED

## Remediation Steps for Graphql Field Suggestions Enabled
The primary risk of enabling Graphql field suggestions is that it may expose potentially sensitive data to malicious or unauthorized users.

### Step 1: Disable Graphql field suggestions
In your GraphQL server setup, determine if Graphql field suggestions are enabled. You may disable them by modifying the server settings. In this example, we use Apollo Server in JavaScript:

```javascript
const server = new ApolloServer({ 
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
  introspection: false, // Disable graphql field suggestions
});
```
### Step 2: Use a production environment configuration
Optionally, to make Graphql field suggestions available in development but not in production, use the `NODE_ENV` variable to manage it. 

```javascript
const server = new ApolloServer({ 
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
  introspection: process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production', 
});
```
### Step 3: Regular Audit and Weekly Review
Audit your codebase regularly and ensure that best security practices are in place. This includes having regular reviews of security policies and practices.

### Step 4: Educate Teams
In addition to the technical steps, it's also important to educate all development team members about the importance of security, to prevent such issues from being reintroduced in the future.
