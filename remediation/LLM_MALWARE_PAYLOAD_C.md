## Remediation Steps for Overreliance on Low Level Mechanisms (LLMs) - Generating Malware Payloads with C
Overreliance on LLMs such as Generating Malware Payloads with C is a security pitfall. Developing your own low level mechanisms can often result in software that is hard to understand, hard to maintain and likely to contain security bugs.

### Step 1: Develop High-Level Mechanisms
Low-Level Mechanisms (LLMs) can easily generate security vulnerabilities if not handled carefully. Use encapsulated language features or libraries that provide high-level functionality.

```c
// Use the following instead of a low level mechanism
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
   printf("This is a high level mechanism\n");
   return 0;
}
```


### Step 2: Use of More Secure Alternatives
Consider the use of secure alternatives to C for critical applications, such as Rust, which has been designed from the ground up with memory safety and security in mind.

```bash
# Example of writing a simple application in Rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```
