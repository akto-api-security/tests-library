# Remediation for SENSITIVE_DATA_EXPOSURE_JAPANESE_SOCIAL_INSURANCE_NUMBER

## Remediation Steps for Sensitive data exposure of Japanese Social Insurance Number
Sensitive data exposure, especially of personal identifiers like a Japanese Social Insurance Number, is a serious security concern. A data breach can lead to significant problems, such as identity theft. Here are the steps to mitigate the risk of such exposure.

### Step 1: Encrypt the Social Insurance Numbers before Storing
Encrypt the sensitive data before storing using strong encryption methods. Below is an example in Python using the `cryptography` library.

```python
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet

# generate a key 
key = Fernet.generate_key()

cipher_suite = Fernet(key)
data = '123-4567-8910'  # Japanese Social Insurance Number

cipher_text = cipher_suite.encrypt(data.encode())
```

### Step 2: Always Use HTTPS for Transmission
Ensure you are using HTTPS for all data in transit, especially on login and registration pages.

```python
import requests

url = 'https://your_api_endpoint'
data = {'insurance_number': cipher_text}
requests.post(url, data=data) 
```

### Step 3: Limit Access to Sensitive Data
Limit access to sensitive data such as Social Insurance Numbers only to those who need it, through strict permission controls.

```python
def display_sensitive_data(user):
    if user.has_permission:
         # Retrieve the data
         encrypted_data = get_sensitive_data_from_db()
         
         # Decrypt the data
         data = cipher_suite.decrypt(encrypted_data)
         return data

    else:
        return "You don't have the permissions to access this data."
```

### Step 4: Regularly Monitor and Update Security Measures
Software updates often include security patches. Regularly update any libraries, services, or infrastructure that your application depends on.
