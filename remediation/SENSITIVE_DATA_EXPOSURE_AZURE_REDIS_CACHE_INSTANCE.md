## Remediation Steps for Sensitive Data Exposure in Azure Redis Cache Instance

Sensitive data exposure in Azure Redis Cache instances is a significant security vulnerability. If not correctly protected, attackers might gain unauthorized access to your cached data. To mitigate this issue, it is implore that the connection to the Redis Cache is secured and access controls are properly set.

### Step 1: Enable Non-SSL Port
Disable the non-SSL port on your Azure Redis Cache to force all clients to use SSL (Secure Socket Layer) connection. This can be done during the creation of the Redis Cache, but if the Cache already exists this can be done under the Advanced tab in your Redis Cache menu. Set the toggle for “Allow access only via SSL” to Yes.

Below is an example using Azure CLI:

```bash
az redis update --name myCache --resource-group myResourceGroup --set enableNonSslPort=false
```

### Step 2: Firewall Configuration
You can specify certain IP addresses or IP ranges that are allowed to connect to your Redis cache. This feature can be found under the "Firewalls and virtual networks" in your Azure Redis Cache menu.

```bash
az redis firewall-rules create --name myRule --resource-group myResourceGroup --start-ip 0.0.0.0 --end-ip 0.0.0.0 --cache-name myCache
```

### Step 3: Regular Audit and Update

Regularly reviewing and updating security settings helps ensure your data's security. The recent activity logs can be checked within the Azure portal, and Azure Advisor can provide additional security recommendations.

```bash
az redis list --resource-group myResourceGroup
```

### Step 4: Use Redis AUTH
Implementing Redis AUTH will ask for a password before granting access to the server.

```bash
redis-cli
auth yourpassword
```
After filling in the password, you should get an OK. For any incorrect password an (error) NOAUTH Authentication required.

Remember to replace "myCache", "myResourceGroup", "myRule" and "yourpassword" with your own details.
