# Remediation for PASSWD_CHANGE_BRUTE_FORCE

## Remediation Steps for Authentication Bypass by Brute Forcing Password Change Endpoint

Authentication Bypass by brute forcing Password Change endpoint is a severe security vulnerability. A malicious actor can potentially exploit this vulnerability to bypass the authentication process by brute-forcing the password change endpoint, thus gaining unauthorized access.

### Step 1: Limit login attempts
One of the most common ways to prevent brute force attacks is to limit the number of failed login attempts from a single IP address.

Here is an example in Python using Flask:

```python
from flask_limiter import Limiter
from flask_limiter.util import get_remote_address

limiter = Limiter(app, key_func=get_remote_address)

@app.route('/login', methods=['POST'])
@limiter.limit("5/minute")  # only allow 5 login attempts per minute from an IP
def login():
    # login code here
    pass
```

### Step 2: Implement Captcha
Captcha can be used to prevent automated scripts from making brute force attacks.

Here is an example in Python using Flask-Captcha:

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template, request
from flask_captcha import ReCaptcha

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config.update({'RECAPTCHA_PUBLIC_KEY': 'your-public-key', 
                   'RECAPTCHA_PRIVATE_KEY': 'your-private-key'})
recaptcha = ReCaptcha(app=app)

@app.route('/login', methods=['POST'])
def login():
    if recaptcha.verify(): 
        # login code here
        pass
    else:
        # flash message for invalid captcha
        pass
```

### Step 3: Implement Account Locking
Account locking can be implemented as another security measure. After a certain number of failed login attempts, the account is locked for a certain period of time.

Example in Python:

```python
# increment failed login count in your login code
failed_count += 1  
if failed_count > max_allowed_attempts:
    lock_account(user_id)
```
