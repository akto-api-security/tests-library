# Remediation for NGINX_ACCEL_EXPOSED

## Remediation Steps for Nginx Accel Header Data Exposed

Nginx Accel Header Data exposed is a significant security risk. Once improperly configured, attackers can exploit it to disclose sensitive information or manipulate internal services. Here are the steps to remediate this vulnerability.

### Step 1: Validate Configuration
Before taking corrective action, verify whether the `X-Accel-Redirect` is misconfigured in your Nginx configuration by looking at server blocks, location blocks, and includes. 

```bash
sudo grep -irn 'x-accel-redirect' /etc/nginx/
```

### Step 2: Configure Server Blocks
If you are using `X-Accel-Redirect` header, ensure that you are limiting its use to intended locations by specifying them in a `location` block in the server configuration and setting the correct internal directives.

```nginx
location ~* ^/internal/ {
    internal;
}
```
### Step 3: Hide X-Accel-Redirect
Make sure to hide `X-Accel-Redirect` header from the client. This can be done by using the `proxy_hide_header` directive.

```nginx
proxy_hide_header X-Accel-Redirect;
```

### Step 4: Review Configuration and Restart Nginx
After changing your Nginx configuration, it's always a good idea to review your changes and test the new configuration before using it. This can be done with the command `nginx -t`. If the configuration is successful, reload Nginx to apply the changes.

```bash
sudo nginx -t
sudo service nginx reload
```

### Step 5: Regular Audit and Update
As with any services, it's always important to ensure you are using the most recent version of Nginx to have the recent security patches. Also, regular audits of your configuration will help keep your server secure.
