## Remediation Steps for Username Enumeration via Different HTTP Response Codes

Username Enumeration is a type of vulnerability that allows an attacker to guess or confirm valid users in a system. This can be brought about due to different HTTP response codes being shown for valid and invalid user-name entries. Here are steps to fix this issue.

### Step 1: Consistent HTTP Response
Ensure that the application returns a consistent HTTP response regardless of whether the username exists or not. For instance, the HTTP 200 OK status code can always be returned. Here is how you can do that in Node.js using Express:

```javascript
app.post('/login', (req, res) => {
    const user = findUser(req.body.username);
    if(user) {
        //Handle login
    } else {
        res.status(200).send('Incorrect username or password');
    }
});
```

### Step 2: Generalize Error Messages
Ensure that error messages are not specific to whether the username exists or not. Use generalized error messages such as "Incorrect username or password". This will make it difficult for the attacker to differentiate between an existing and non-existing user.

### Step 3: Implement Account Lockout
Implement an account lockout mechanism such that an account gets locked out after a certain number of unsuccessful login attempts. This way, username enumeration attacks are harder to perform.

```javascript
let attempts = 0;

app.post('/login', (req, res) => {
    const user = findUser(req.body.username);
    if(user) {
        if(attempts >= MAX_ATTEMPTS){
            res.status(200).send('Account locked due to too many login attempts');
            // Lock the account 
        } else {
        // Handle login
        }
    } else {
        attempts++;
        res.status(200).send('Incorrect username or password');
    }
});
```
