# Remediation for BYPASS_DELIVERY_FEES_VALIDATION

## Remediation Steps for Bypass Delivery Fees Validation
Bypassing delivery fees validation is a serious security concern. Not properly validating delivery fees can result in substantial financial losses. One can circumvent this issue by implementing robust server-side validation. Here, I'm using Python (Flask) for demonstration.

### Step 1: Understand the Validation Requirements
Understand your business requirements for delivery fees. Some businesses may have standard fees, some may vary based on location, package size, or weight, etc. Update these requirements regularly to ensure accuracy.

### Step 2: Implement Server-Side Validation
On the server-side, write code for delivery fees validation. Never rely on client-side validations as they can be easily bypassed.

```python
from flask import Flask, request, abort
from decimal import Decimal

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/checkout', methods=['POST'])
def checkout():
    data = request.get_json()

    # validate the delivery fee
    if 'delivery_fee' not in data:
        abort(400, 'Delivery fee missing')

    # try converting to Decimal
    try:
        fee = Decimal(data['delivery_fee'])
    except:
        abort(400, 'Invalid delivery fee')

    # validate the amount
    if fee < Decimal('0.00') or fee > Decimal('50.00'):
        abort(400, 'Delivery fee out of range')

    # ... continue processing the order ...

    return {"status": "Order processed successfully"}

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

### Step 3: Include Error Handling and Notifications
Ensure to include ample error handling in your code to notify both the user and yourself (as an administrator or developer) if any validation issues occur.

```python
@app.errorhandler(400)
def handle_bad_request(e):
    # log the error
    logging.error(e)

    # send notification 
    send_error_notification(e)

    # respond with a user-friendly message
    return 'Bad Request: {}'.format(e), 400
```

By performing these steps, you can help prevent the bypass of delivery fees validation.
