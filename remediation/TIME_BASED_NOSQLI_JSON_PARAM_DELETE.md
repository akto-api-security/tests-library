## Remediation Steps for Time-based NoSQL Injection in JSON Body Parameters with Javascript

Time-based NoSQL injection is a serious security issue that exposes your JSON body parameters to potential unauthorized data access. By manipulating the time delay in the server response, an attacker can extract data from your database. Following remediation steps guide you on how to correct this vulnerability.

### Step 1: Data validation

Always validate user inputs before letting them interact with your database. Never trust data coming from the user. In Node.js, you can use packages like `express-validator` for easy validation.

```javascript
var express = require('express');
var router = express.Router();
const { check, validationResult } = require('express-validator');

router.post(
  '/user',
  [
    check('username').isLength({ min: 5 }),
    check('password').isStrongPassword(),
  ],
  function (req, res) {
    const errors = validationResult(req);
    if(!errors.isEmpty()){
     return res.status(400).json({ errors: errors.array() });
    }
    //...
  }
);
```

### Step 2: Use Parameterized Queries

Instead of allowing direct user input to be part of your queries, you should use parameterized queries. Most libraries allow this feature.

```javascript
db.collection('users').find({ username: req.body.username })
```

### Step 3: Limit Returned Data

Even if an attacker succeeds to trigger a scan of the entire collection, limit the amount of returned data that can be accessed.

```javascript
db.collection('users').find({}).limit(1)
```

### Step 4: Monitoring and Logging

Detecting NoSQL injection, or any kind of malicious activity, can be really simple if you log every query hitting your database. This way you can simply check for any suspicious activities and react accordingly.
