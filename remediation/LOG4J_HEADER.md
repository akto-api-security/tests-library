# Remediation for LOG4J_HEADER

## Remediation Steps for Log4j Vulnerability in HTTP Request Headers

The Log4j vulnerability, also known as Log4Shell, is a security flaw that can allow remote code execution on a server. The vulnerability makes it possible for an attacker to inject malicious data into HTTP request headers, which can then be logged and processed by the Log4j library, leading to arbitrary code execution.

### Step 1: Identify Vulnerable Systems
First, determine the systems where the vulnerable version of Log4j is being used. The versions that are affected by the vulnerability are from 2.0-beta9 to 2.14.1.

```bash
find / -name 'log4j*.jar'
```

### Step 2: Update Log4j Library
If you are using a version of Log4j that is known to be vulnerable, update to Log4j 2.15.0 or later (If available).

For Maven:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.logging.log4j</groupId>
    <artifactId>log4j-core</artifactId>
    <version>2.15.0</version>
</dependency>
```

For Gradle:

```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation 'org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core:2.15.0'
}
```

### Step 3: Configuration Change
If you can't update immediately, a temporary workaround can be to set the `log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups` system property to `true`.

For Java applications:

```java
System.setProperty("log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups", "true");
```

Or, this can be done at the time of JVM start by adding this to the JVM parameters:

```bash
-Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true
```

Please note that the above remediation steps do not cover all possible configurations and systems, and they might not be applicable to all environments. 

### Step 4: Regularly Update and Monitor Systems
Regular audits and updates of your systems can prevent future vulnerabilities. Check regularly for updates from the Apache Logging Services Project to ensure your Log4j Library is up-to-date. Also, be sure to monitor logs and network traffic for any signs of intrusion or suspicious activity.
