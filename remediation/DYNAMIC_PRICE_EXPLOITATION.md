# Remediation for DYNAMIC_PRICE_EXPLOITATION

## Remediation Steps for Dynamic Price Exploitation

Dynamic pricing is a strategy that businesses use to adjust their prices based on variables like demand, availability, customer profiles etc. Unfortunately, if not handled securely, attackers can exploit this strategy to get prices lower than they should be. This is commonly known as Dynamic Price Exploitation.

### Step 1: Validate Prices Server-Side 
The most effective remediation step is to perform server-side validation of prices before making a financial transaction. Do not rely solely on client-side inputs as they can be manipulated.
```java
if (!serverPrice.equals(clientPrice)) {
    throw new InvalidProductPriceException("Prices don't match. Possible Price Tampering Detected!!");
}
```

### Step 2: Use Secure Tokens
You can use secure tokens associated with each price update to tie a client to a specific price at a given time. Each token should be securely generated and tightly coupled with your price.

```java
// Method to generate secure token for a price
public String generateSecureToken(Double price) {
    // Use a secure random generator and concatenate it with price to generate the token.
    SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();
    String token = new BigInteger(130, random).toString(32);
    return token + price;
}
```

### Step 3: SSL Encryption
Use SSL encryption for all communications between client and server, including price details.
