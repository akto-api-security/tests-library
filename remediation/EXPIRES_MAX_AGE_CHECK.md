## Remediation Steps for Session Token Storing via Persistent Cookie Test
Storing a session token in a persistent cookie is a security risk that may lead to session hijacking. Implementing proper storage for session tokens is a key defense against unauthorized access to your application.

### Step 1: Store Session Tokens in HTTPOnly Cookies
```python
from flask import Flask, session
app = Flask(__name__)
@app.route('/')
def home():
    resp = make_response('Set session token in HTTPOnly cookie.')
    resp.set_cookie('session_token', session['session_token'], httponly=True, secure=True)
    return resp
```
This step involves storing session tokens inside HTTPOnly cookies, which cannot be accessed via JavaScript. This drastically reduces the chance of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

### Step 2: Use Secure Cookies
Ensure the use of Secure cookies to make sure that the session tokens are only transmitted over HTTPS encrypted connections.

```python
@app.route('/')
def secure_cookie():
    resp = make_response('Set secure session cookie.')
    resp.set_cookie('session_token', session['session_token'], secure=True, httponly=True)
    return resp
```
Secure attribute ensures the cookie is only sent over an HTTPS connection.

### Step 3: Implement Token Expiration/Invalidation
Tokens should have a limited lifespan, and invalidate automatically after a certain time period or certain circumstances. For example, a token should be invalidated after a logout operation.

```python
@app.route('/logout')
def logout():
    # Remove the user information from the session
    session.pop('logged_in', None)
    session.pop('session_token', None)
    return redirect(url_for('home'))
```
### Step 4: Reissue Tokens for Sensitive Actions
After completing critical events or transactions, tokens should be regenerated.

```python
@app.route('/complete_transaction')
def complete_transaction():
    # Complete transaction logic here...
    
    # Reissue session token
    session['session_token'] = generate_new_token()
    return redirect(url_for('home'))
```
