# Remediation for SPRING_BOOT_ENV_ACTUATOR_EXPOSED

## Remediation Steps for Spring Boot Environment Actuator Exposed

Exposing Spring Boot Environment Actuator makes your applications highly vulnerable by showing sensitive environment properties. These can be used maliciously if intercepted by unauthorized entities.

### Step 1: Disable Actuator Endpoints Globally
You can disable the exposure of actuator endpoints globally by setting the following property in the `application.properties` file. 

```java
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include= # to completely disable
```
Or you can disable it selectively like so:
```java
management.endpoints.web.exposure.exclude=env,beans # for disabling specific endpoints
```

### Step 2: Secure Actuator Endpoints With Spring Security
Make use of Spring Security to secure actuator endpoints by adding it as a dependency in your `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-security</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

Then, configure Spring Security to provide access only to authenticated users:

```java
@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {
    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http
         .authorizeRequests()
         .antMatchers("/actuator/**").authenticated()
         .and()
         .httpBasic();
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Regular Monitoring and Audit
Regular monitoring and auditing of application usage and logs is necessary to detect unusual activity or security breaches. This could be set up depending on the specific technology or toolset utilized in your infrastructure.

### Step 4: Update Spring Security Regularly
Spring Security's team regularly releases patches and updates that address bugs and vulnerabilities. Keep your version updated to the latest stable release to ensure maximum security. Regularly check the official Spring Security website and follow their update guide accordingly.
