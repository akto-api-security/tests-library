# Remediation for LOGSTASH_API_EXPOSED

## Remediation Steps for Exposed Logstash
Exposed Logstash is a critical security issue that can leave sensitive data exposed to unauthorized individuals. Therefore, it is vital to properly secure Logstash to maintain data integrity and prevent data leaks.
### Step 1: Enable X-Pack Security
X-Pack security features provide a built-in user database for convenience. You can also configure Logstash to use LDAP, Active Directory, PKI, SAML, or a custom realm.
```bash
xpack.security.enabled: true
```
### Step 2: Configure Logstash to Use Security Features 
Without enabling the security features, Logstash will run in minimal mode. Itâ€™s important to set up authentication and encrypted communications.
```bash
output.elasticsearch:
  hosts: ["localhost:9200"]
  user: "logstash_internal"
  password: "password"
```
### Step 3: Configuring Role-Based Access Control
Secure your Elasticsearch clusters by configuring role-based access control, which will limit access to both indices and Logstash areas.
```bash
PUT /_security/role/logstash_writer
{
  "cluster": ["manage_index_templates", "monitor", "manage_ilm"],
  "indices": [
    {
      "names": ["logstash-*"],
      "privileges": ["write","delete","create_index","view_index_metadata"]
    }
  ]
}
```
### Step 4: Regular Audit and Update
Much like any other security practice, it is crucial to regularly audit Logstash for any vulnerability and update it whenever necessary.
```bash
bin/logstash-plugin update 
```
