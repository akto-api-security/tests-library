# Remediation for BOLA_URL_INSERT_API_VERSION_DELETE

## Remediation Steps for Exploiting BOLA by Inserting API Version IDs in URL path for Unauthorized Access with DELETE Based APIs
Exploiting BOLA (Broken Object Level Authorization) can potentially lead to unauthorized access of sensitive data and functions. It happens if APIs are not properly secured and version IDs can be inserted into the URL path to gain access. 
### Step 1: Update and Validate the API Server
Use a middleware function to validate every request and update any necessary server settings. For example in Node.js with Express:
```javascript
app.all('*', function (req, res, next) {
    var versionId = req.params.versionId;
    if (!versionId) { // Check the URL path for versionId
        res.status(400).send("Missing versionId");
    } else if (!(req.session && req.session.user && req.session.user.roles.includes('admin'))) { // Check if the logged in user is an admin
        res.status(403).send("Not authorized");
    } else {
        next();
    }
});
```
### Step 2: Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
RBAC restricts network access based on the role. Roles are defined according to job authority and responsibility within your organization. This not only limits unauthorized access but also ensures that, even when access is granted, itâ€™s limited to what's necessary to perform their job tasks. In Node.js, a library like connect-roles can be used to easily implement RBAC.
```javascript
var ConnectRoles = require('connect-roles');
var user = new ConnectRoles({
  failureHandler: function (req, res, action) {
    var accept = req.headers.accept || '';
    res.status(403).send("Access Denied - You don't have permission to: " + action);
  }
});

user.use('delete', function (req) {
  if (req.session.user && req.session.user.roles.includes('admin')) {
    return true;
  }
});
```
### Step 3: Regularly Update and Audit Your System
Ensure you regularly update and audit your system to prevent any unauthorized access and fix potential loopholes in your security system. In Node.js: 
```bash
npm audit fix
```
### Step 4: Implement Proper Error Handling
Implement proper error handling to avoid exposing unnecessary information in error messages which can provide clues to attackers on your application's inner workings.
```javascript
app.use(function (err, req, res, next) {
  console.error(err.stack);
  res.status(500).send('Something broke!');
});
```
### Step 5: Handle API versioning properly
Instead of exposing API version in the URL, consider using media type versioning by specifying the version of API in the Accept header. This avoids version IDs being tampered in the URL.
```javascript
app.get('/api/resource', function (req, res, next) {
  var version = req.get('Accept').split('-')[1] || 'v1';
  if (version === 'v1') {
    handleV1Request(req, res, next);
  } else if (version === 'v2') {
    handleV2Request(req, res, next);
  } else {
    next(new Error('Invalid API version'));
  }
});
```
