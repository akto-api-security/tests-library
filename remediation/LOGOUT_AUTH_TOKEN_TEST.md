## Remediation Steps for Authentication Bypass with Logged Out Token in APIs

Authentication Bypass using logged out tokens can be a severe security flaw, as attackers can use old tokens to access authenticated APIs. Thus, it's a necessity to set up security mechanisms to validate tokens in your system effectively.

### Step 1: Invalidate tokens after logout
You should set up your system to invalidate tokens after a user logs out. In simple terms, delete the token from your system or mark it as invalid as soon as the user logs out.

If you use JWT for authentication, you could mark logged-out tokens with a logout list (or a black list). Here's an example in python:

```python
from flask import Flask, jsonify, request
from flask_jwt_extended import JWTManager, jwt_required, create_access_token, get_jwt

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['JWT_SECRET_KEY'] = 'super-secret'  # Change this!
jwt = JWTManager(app)

@jwt.token_in_blocklist_loader
def check_if_token_in_blocklist(jwt_header, jwt_payload):
    jti = jwt_payload['jti']
    token_in_redis = redis.get(jti)
    return token_in_redis is not None

@app.route('/logout', methods=['POST'])
@jwt_required()
def logout():
    jti = get_jwt()['jti']
    redis.set(jti, '', ex=current_app.config['JWT_ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRES'])
    return jsonify({"msg": "Successfully logged out"}), 200
```

### Step 2: Regularly rotate tokens

To limit the misuse of a token even if it is leaked, set an expiration policy for the tokens. The expiration can be in terms of a specific duration (e.g., 30 minutes, 1 hour).

```python
from datetime import timedelta
# expires the token in 1 hour
access_token = create_access_token('username', expires_delta=timedelta(hours=1))
```

### Step 3: Implement Refresh Tokens

Even with token expiration, one way to ensure a smooth user experience is by using refresh tokens. When the access token is expired, the system can use the refresh token to get a new access token.

```python
from flask_jwt_extended import create_refresh_token
# create a refresh token
refresh_token = create_refresh_token('username')
```

Remember, when a user logs out, both the access token and the refresh token should be invalidated.
