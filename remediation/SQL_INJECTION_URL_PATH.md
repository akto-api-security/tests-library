# Remediation for SQL_INJECTION_URL_PATH

## Remediation Steps for SQL Injection Test via Special Inputs for Verbose Error Messages
SQL Injection through special inputs resulting in verbose error messages is a critical vulnerability which allows potential attackers to gain insights into the database structure and data. 

### Step 1: Use Parameterized Queries
In every known programming language, it is recommended to use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injections. This leverages the database engine to distinguish between code and data, irrespective of what input is supplied.

```python
from django.db import connection, IntegrityError

try:  
    with connection.cursor() as cursor:
        cursor.execute("INSERT INTO mytable (column) VALUES (%s)", [user_input])
except IntegrityError:
    handle_exception()
```

### Step 2: Use ORM Tools
ORM tools shield you from SQL injection vulnerabilities by escaping special characters using parameterized queries or statements.

For example, in Django you can use QuerySet API which protects your database from SQL injection since its methods are implemented using parameterized queries.

### Step 3: Validate User Input
All user input should be validated and sanitized. Any form of input (parameters received from user, API, files) should be checked.

```python
import re
user_input = "special string with ' or ; to trick"
sanitize_input = re.sub('[^A-Za-z0-9]+', '', user_input)  #sanitize input
```

### Step 4: Handle Exceptions and Error Messages
Use generic error messages to prevent information disclosure about your database to an attacker. Do not send verbose error details in production environments.

```python
try:
    ... # some database operation
except DatabaseError:
    return "An error occurred."
```

### Step 5: Regular Audit and Update
The framework, libraries, and dependencies being used should be kept up to date. Regular audits will reduce the chances of known vulnerabilities. Use automated updates where possible or include it in your regular maintenance activities.
