# Remediation for SSRF_ON_CSV_UPLOAD_GCP_REDIRECT

## Remediation Steps for Exposed Sensitive GCP Details
Sensitive GCP (Google Cloud Platform) details, when exposed due to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), can pose a severe security risk. Unauthorized users may gain access to confidential data or manipulate GCP resources. This commonly arises when a CSV parameter is replaced with a redirection.

### Step 1: Validate All URL Inputs
All URLs must be validated. Only let through URLs that follow the desired structure, ensuring that the attacker cannot change the URL's structure to initiate SSRF attacks.
```python
import re
def validate_url(url):
    pattern = re.compile('^(http|https)://[a-zA-Z0-9-\\.]+/desired/url/path')
    return pattern.match(url)
```

### Step 2: Limit or Avoid User-Supplied URLs
Limiting functionality that allows users to supply a URL can help stop SSRF attacks.
```python
def use_hardcoded_urls(url):
    URL_WHITELIST = ['url1', 'url2', 'url3']
    if url not in URL_WHITELIST:
        raise ValueError('Invalid URL!')
```

### Step 3: Employ a Web Application Firewall (WAF)
A WAF can limit the likelihood of the SSRF vulnerability by filtering out malicious requests.
```bash
# This is a hypothetical command; actual installation will vary on different platforms.
sudo apt-get install [WAF]
```

### Step 4: Updated Responsibilities in GCP
It's important to compartmentalize access to different resources in GCP by defining separate roles in Identity and Access Management (IAM). This prevents access to certain data even if SSRF occurs.
```bash
# example using gcloud command-line tool
gcloud projects get-iam-policy myproject > iam_policy.json
# edit the iam_policy.json file to adjust roles then update the IAM policy
gcloud projects set-iam-policy myproject iam_policy.json
```

### Step 5: Regular Audit and Update
Always ensure to carry out a regular check of your GCP for any unauthorized changes to IAM policies or usage of resources.
```bash
gcloud projects get-iam-policy myproject
```

Remember, prevention is the best form of protection against any security vulnerability.
