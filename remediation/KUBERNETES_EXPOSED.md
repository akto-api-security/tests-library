## Remediation Steps for Kubernetes APIs Exposure

Kubernetes APIs exposure is a serious security concern. Malicious actors with unauthorized access to these APIs may perform numerous harmful actions, such as data theft, resource abuse, or denial-of-service attacks. It is therefore crucial to properly secure the Kubernetes APIs.

### Step 1: Use RBAC for Access Control
Role-based access control (RBAC) is a method of regulating access to computer or network resources based on users' roles within your organization.
```bash
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  namespace: default
  name: pod-reader
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["pods"]
  verbs: ["get", "watch", "list"]
```
### Step 2: Use Network Policies
Network policies specify how groups of pods are allowed to communicate with each other and other network endpoints.
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: default-deny
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
```
### Step 3: Disable anonymous access
By default, requests to the Kubernetes API server are allowed anonymous access. You can disable this by setting the `--anonymous-auth=false` flag in the API server.
```bash
kube-apiserver --anonymous-auth=false
```
### Step 4: Enable Audit Logging
Audit logs provide a security-relevant chronological set of records documenting the sequence of activities that have affected system by individual users, administrator or system itself.
```bash
kube-apiserver --audit-log-path=/var/log/kubernetes/apiserver/audit.log
```
