# Remediation for JETTY_OLD_INFO_LEAKAGE

## Remediation Steps for Jetty v9.2.9 Sensitive Information Leakage

Jetty v9.2.9 is known to be vulnerable to sensitive information leakage issues. As a result, malicious users may be able to retrieve critical data, potentially compromising your system. Follow these steps to address the problem.

### Step 1: Update Eclipse Jetty

The data leak issue is resolved in the higher versions of Eclipse Jetty. Therefore, the first step in mitigating the issue is by updating Jetty to the latest version or at least to a version that is not vulnerable to the issue. Use the following command to update Jetty:

```bash
sudo apt-get upgrade jetty
```

### Step 2: Validate the Installation

Upon successful update of Jetty, ensure that your new installation is no longer vulnerable to the sensitive information leak issue. You can do this by leveraging a vulnerability scanning tool. This step is crucial to ensure that the vulnerability no longer lies in your system.

### Step 3: Regular Audits and Updates

Regular auditing of your application and keeping it updated helps prevent such vulnerabilities. Always keep your software and all dependencies updated to the latest stable version.

Use the following command to regularly update all your system's packages:

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
```

### Step 4: Code Review and Testing 

Carry out code reviews regularly and before production deployments to catch and rectify any potential leaks. More comprehensive and regular tests, including penetration tests, can identify vulnerabilities or leaks that have been missed previously.

### Step 5: Use of HTTPS 

Wherever possible, use HTTPS instead of HTTP to ensure secure communications and prevent potential information leaks.

By carrying out these remediation steps, you should be able to successfully mitigate the Jetty v9.2.9 sensitive information leakage vulnerability.
