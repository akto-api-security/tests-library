## Remediation Steps for Sensitive Data Exposure - Credit Card Information

Sensitive data exposure is a critical security vulnerability. Without proper handling and encryption, sensitive data like credit card information can be exposed to unauthorized parties. Try following the below steps to secure your application from such vulnerability.

### Step 1: Encrypt Sensitive Data at Rest and in Transit
Use libraries that support encryption and decryption of sensitive data. A simple way in Python would be via the `pycryptodome` library.

```python
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
from Crypto.Random import get_random_bytes

def encrypt_data(data):
    key = get_random_bytes(32)
    cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_EAX)
    ciphertext, tag = cipher.encrypt_and_digest(data)
    return ciphertext

def decrypt_data(ciphertext, key, tag):
    cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_EAX)
    nonce = cipher.nonce
    plaintext = cipher.decrypt(ciphertext)
    return plaintext
```

### Step 2: Apply Proper Validation Checks 
Avoid direct use of user inputs for processing sensitive data. Always validate the inputs before processing them. Here is a simple function to validate credit card number using Luhn's algorithm in JavaScript:

```javascript
function luhnCheck(value) {
    let nCheck = 0, nDigit = 0, bEven = false;
    value = value.toString().replace(/\D/g, "");

    for (let n = value.length - 1; n >= 0; n--) {
        let cDigit = value.charAt(n),
            nDigit = parseInt(cDigit, 10);

        if (bEven && (nDigit *= 2) > 9) nDigit -= 9;

        nCheck += nDigit;
        bEven = !bEven;
    }
    return (nCheck % 10) == 0;
}
```

### Step 3: Limit Exposure of Sensitive Data
Never log sensitive data and avoid displaying it unnecessarily. Remove sensitive data immediately after the intended use is over.

### Step 4: Have a Strong Password Policy
A strong password policy would prevent hackers from cracking passwords and accessing credit card data. 

### Step 5: Follow PCI DSS Compliance
If you're handling credit card data, it's important to adhere to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) to ensure you maintain a secure environment.
