## Remediation Steps for Sensitive Data Exposure for AWS DOCDB URL

Sensitive data exposure through AWS Document DB URLs is a serious security concern. If not properly secured, attackers could gain unauthorized access to DocumentDB causing serious threats to the data and the entire application. To remediate the issue, follow these steps to secure your AWS DocDB URL.

### Step 1: Use IAM Database Authentication

Instead of including credentials in your DocDB URL, use IAM database authentication that generates an authentication token which will be used to connect to your DocumentDB cluster.

```bash
aws rds generate-db-auth-token --hostname docdb-2019-03-25-16-12-34.cluster-cvte16ffayfx.us-west-2.docdb.amazonaws.com --port 27017 --region us-west-2 --username myawsuser
```

The above command generates an authentication token that can be used in your DocDB URL.

### Step 2: Enable Network Isolation

Use either Amazon DocumentDB VPC or establish a VPN to your Amazon VPC to ensure that all network traffic between your application and DocumentDB is isolated.

### Step 3: Configure Security Groups

Configure your security groups to ensure that only trusted IP addresses are allowed to access the DocDB.

```bash
aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --region us-west-2 --group-id sg-xxxxxxxx --protocol tcp --port 27017 --cidr 203.0.113.0/24
```

The above command allows only the specified CIDR IP range to access the DocumentDB.

### Step 4: Regular Audit 

Use AWS CloudTrail for auditing and monitoring activities in your AWS environment which will help you to track the requests for your DocDB cluster.

### Step 5: Implement DocumentDB encryption

AWS DocumentDB supports encryption at rest. Enable this feature to ensure protection for your static data.

### Step 6: Enable SSL 

Enable SSL for Amazon DocumentDB cluster. Make sure that all of your applications use SSL for connections.

```bash
mongo --ssl --host docdb-2019-03-25-16-12-34.cluster-cvte16ffayfx.us-west-2.docdb.amazonaws.com:27017 --sslCAFile rds-combined-ca-bundle.pem --username myawsuser --password password
```

The above command will connect your application to the DocDB cluster by using SSL connection.

By following these steps, sensitive data exposure via AWS DocDB URL can be avoided.
