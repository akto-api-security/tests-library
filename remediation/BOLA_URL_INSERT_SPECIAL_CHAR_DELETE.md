# Remediation for BOLA_URL_INSERT_SPECIAL_CHAR_DELETE

## Remediation Steps for BOLA (Broken Object Level Authorization) Exploitation through Special Characters in URL Path 

BOLA vulnerabilities occur when a user is able to manipulate object references to access global objects they are not authorized to. In case of URLs, this can be exploited by using special characters. API endpoints targeted with DELETE requests could lead to unauthorized deletions of data.

### Step 1: Apply URL Encoding
Ensure proper encoding is applied to URL paths to prevent manipulation via special characters. 

```java
String securePath = URLEncoder.encode(userInput, "UTF-8");
```

### Step 2: Implement Proper Authorization Checks

Make sure to check if a user is authorized to perform a DELETE request before proceeding with the operation. 

```java
if (user.isAuthorized()) {
    // Proceed with DELETE operation
} else {
    throw new UnauthorizedException("User is not authorized to perform this action.");
}
```

### Step 3: Validate and Sanitize User Inputs 

Validating and sanitizing user inputs is very important when dealing with URL paths. Avoid trusting user inputs blindly and always sanitize them to remove any malicious data.

```java
boolean isValid = URLValidator.isValid(userInput);
if (isValid) {
    // sanitize input
    String sanitizedInput = InputSanitizer.sanitize(userInput);
} else {
    throw new ValidationException("Invalid URL.");
}
```

### Step 4: Use Anti-BOLA Design Patterns
- Implement indirect object references, which ensures that only authorized objects are accessible for each user.
- Implement a request map to validate URL ids against session ids, this adds an additional confirmation step. 
- Use UUIDs instead of numerical IDs, making it much harder to guess valid IDs.
