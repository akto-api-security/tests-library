## Remediation Steps for Command Injection with Chaining System Commands

Command injection attacks can lead to serious security issues. The attacker can take full control of system operations and compromise the entire system. An 'arithmetic expression execution with echo' vulnerability is particularly dangerous as it can aid in executing malicious system commands. 

### Step 1: Avoid using system commands from user inputs
Avoid using system commands directly combined with user inputs within your application. This prevents user input from executing system applications.

```java
// BAD Practice: Using system commands with user inputs
Runtime.getRuntime().exec("echo " + userInput);

// GOOD Practice: Avoiding system commands with user inputs
System.out.println(userInput);
```

### Step 2: Usage of Prepared Statements
Using prepared statements or parameterized queries is a great way to prevent command injection vulnerabilities

In Python:
```python
# BAD Practice: Using system commands with user inputs
os.system(f'echo {user_input}')

# GOOD Practice: Avoiding system commands with user inputs
print(user_input)
```

### Step 3: Sanitize User Inputs
Sanitizing user data is a common strategy to prevent command injection attacks. Using helper libraries like Jsoup for Java, HtmlSanitizer for .Net or html-sanitize for Ruby can assist.

In Java:
```java
import org.jsoup.Jsoup;
import org.jsoup.safety.Whitelist;

String safe = Jsoup.clean(userInput, Whitelist.none());
```

### Step 4: Use Least Privilege Principle
Constrict the permissions of the applications, so even if a command gets injected, the damage is limited.

```bash
chmod 644 my_application
```
