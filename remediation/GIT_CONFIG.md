# Remediation for GIT_CONFIG

## Remediation Steps for Git Config Disclosure
Git Config disclosure could be a harmful security issue. It can expose sensitive information which could be used maliciously. 

### Step 1: Understanding Git Config File
The .gitconfig file is a text file that contains configuration settings for Git on a per-user basis. You should carefully manage the file to not expose any sensitive data.

### Step 2: Delete Sensitive Information
Delete any sensitive information like usernames, passwords, or API keys from the config file. After removal, commit the changes.

```bash
git commit -a -m "Removed sensitive information from config"
```

### Step 3: Purge Sensitive Information from Git History

Use the [BFG Repo-Cleaner](https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/) tool to remove the sensitive information from your Git history. Install the tool and then run the following command:

```bash
bfg --delete-files .gitconfig
```

Then, force push your changes to overwrite the history:

```bash
git push --force
```

### Step 4: Use Environment Variables for Sensitive Information

Use environment variables for storing sensitive information instead of hard-coding them into your code or config files. You can set these variables in the terminal like this:

```bash
export API_KEY='YOUR_SECRET_API_KEY'
```

And then access these environment variables in your code. 

Python Example:

```python
import os
api_key = os.getenv('API_KEY')
```

Java Example:

```java
String key = System.getenv("API_KEY");
```

**Remember**: Never publish your `.gitconfig` or any other sensitive files or folders to public repositories.

### Step 5: Include .gitconfig in .gitignore

Ensure that the `.gitconfig` file is included in your `.gitignore` file to prevent it from being tracked by Git and possibly pushed to a public repository:

```bash
echo '.gitconfig' >> .gitignore
git commit -a -m "Added .gitconfig to .gitignore"
```

### Step 6: Regular Code Review
Remember to conduct regular code reviews to ensure that no sensitive data is accidentally committed and pushed. For this, you can use various tools to automate the process and make it more effective.
