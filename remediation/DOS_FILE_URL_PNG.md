# Remediation for DOS_FILE_URL_PNG

## Remediation Steps for Denial of Service Attacks via Large PNG File Upload

Denial of Service (DoS) attacks by uploading large PNG file is a common security issue. To avoid this, ensure the system has policies in place to validate the size and type of files being uploaded. 

Here are the mitigation steps:

### Step 1: Validate File Type

Before processing any file, ensure the file is of the expected type. Here is an example using Node.js and its 'file-type' module.

```javascript
const FileType = require('file-type');
const readChunk = require('read-chunk');

const buffer = readChunk.sync('file.png', 0, FileType.minimumBytes);
const type = FileType.fromBuffer(buffer);

if (type && type.ext === 'png') {
    console.log('Valid PNG file');
} else {
    console.log('File is not a PNG');
}
```

### Step 2: Heed File Size 

It's essential to limit the size of the file. In the example below, if a file is larger than 5MB, an error will be thrown. In Node.js, Express has a built-in `limit` function on the `bodyParser.json()` and `bodyParser.urlencoded()` middleware.

```javascript
app.use(bodyParser.json({limit: '5mb'}));
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({limit: '5mb', extended: true}));
```

### Step 3: Implement Rate Limiting 

Rate limiting ensures a user (identified by IP address in this case) can't upload too many files too quickly, providing extra protection against DoS attacks. 

This example uses the 'express-rate-limit' module.

```javascript
const rateLimit = require("express-rate-limit");

// Only allow 100 requests per hour per user/IP
const fileUploadLimiter = rateLimit({
    windowMs: 60 * 60 * 1000 , 
    max: 100
});

app.use("/upload-file", fileUploadLimiter);
```
