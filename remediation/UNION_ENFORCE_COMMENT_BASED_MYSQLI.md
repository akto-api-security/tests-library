## Remediation Steps for Union-based SQL Injection Tests with Enforcing Comment Character Payloads for MySQL on Login Endpoints

Union-based SQL Injection is a type of SQL Injection attack that uses the SQL UNION operator to combine the results of the original query with results from injected malicious SQL statements. Without proper mitigation, this vulnerability can lead to unauthorized data access, tampering, and in some cases, even complete system compromise.

### Step 1: Use Prepared Statements

Prepared Statements or parameterized queries ensure that inputs are treated strictly as data and not executable code. Here's an example using PHP:

```php
$uname = $_POST['username'];
$passw = $_POST['password'];

$stmt = $conn->prepare("SELECT * FROM Users WHERE UserName=? AND Password=?"); 
$stmt->bind_param("ss", $uname, $passw); 

$stmt->execute();
```

### Step 2: Employ a Web Application Firewall (WAF)

A Web Application Firewall can provide an additional security layer by recognizing and mitigating known attack patterns like SQL injections.

```bash
sudo apt-get install mod-security
sudo service apache2 restart
```


### Step 3: Limit Database Permissions

Make sure that accounts associated with web applications have the least privileges necessary.

```sql
CREATE USER 'newuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON table_name TO 'newuser'@'localhost';
```

### Step 4: Validate and Sanitize All Inputs

```php
$username_input = $_POST['username'];
$username = filter_var($username_input, FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING);
```
