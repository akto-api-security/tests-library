## Remediation Steps for BOLA: Turning JSON Param into Integer Array for Unauthorized Access with PATCH/PUT method APIs

In order to address the security issue of "BOLA: Turning JSON Params into Integer Array for Unauthorized Access with PATCH/PUT method APIs", be sure to validate user input extensively on your server side API endpoints. The following steps demonstrate how to fix the issue.

### Step 1: Validate Input

Before processing the PATCH/PUT request on your server, validate the input to ensure that it contains expected data types and values. Here is an example in Python using Flask and Marshmallow for data validation:

```python
from flask import Flask, request
from marshmallow import Schema, fields, ValidationError

class IntegerArraySchema(Schema):
    id_list = fields.List(fields.Integer(), required=True)

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/api/resource', methods=['PATCH'])
def patch_resource():
    schema = IntegerArraySchema()

    try:
        result = schema.load(request.json)
        id_list = result['id_list']
    except ValidationError as err:
        return {"errors": err.messages}, 400

    # Use id_list for further processing...
    return {"status": "success"}, 200
```

This code will only allow PATCH requests to /api/resource that contain a list of integers. Any other type of data will result in a validation error and a 400 response to the client.

### Step 2: Enforce Access Control

After validating the input, make sure that the authenticated user has permission to modify the resources that they are trying to modify. An example might be:

```python
    # ...
    # Use id_list for further processing...

    # Check permissions
    user = get_authenticated_user()

    for id in id_list:
        resource = get_resource_by_id(id)

        if not user.has_permission_to_modify(resource):
            return {"error": "You are not authorized to modify this resource."}, 403

    # Continue processing...
```
This will ensure that even if an attacker can manipulate the id_list parameter, they will not be able to modify resources that they are not authorized to modify.

### Step 3: Regularly Update And Review Code

In order to prevent issues similar to this one, it is vital to keep libraries and frameworks used in your application up-to-date. Regularly review your code to make sure any potential vulnerabilities have been addressed.

```bash
pip install --upgrade flask marshmallow psycopg2
```

In conclusion, by validating input and enforcing access control rules, you can mitigate the risk of BOLA attacks via PATCH/PUT API endpoints.
