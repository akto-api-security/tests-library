# Remediation for LARGE_XML_HANDLING

## Remediation Steps for Large XML Handling

Large XML handling can lead to security risks such as Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. An attacker could send an extraordinarily large XML file which can consume server resources leading to a slowdown or a complete server halt. 

### Step 1: Limit XML file size 
First, limit the size of the XML files accepted by the system. Opt for rejecting files over a certain size threshold. This can help prevent Overflow Attacks.

```java
// Java code
import javax.xml.parsers.*;

...

DocumentBuilderFactory dbf = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();
dbf.setFeature(XMLConstants.FEATURE_SECURE_PROCESSING, true);

// Set the maximum document size.
dbf.setAttribute("http://apache.org/xml/properties/input-buffer-size", MAX_SIZE);
```

### Step 2: Use a Streaming API for XML (StAX) 

XML Streaming API for Java (StAX) can efficiently handle large XML files. 

```java
// Java code
import javax.xml.stream.*;

...

XMLInputFactory factory = XMLInputFactory.newFactory();
XMLStreamReader reader = factory.createXMLStreamReader(new FileInputStream("large.xml"));

while(reader.hasNext()) {
    int eventType = reader.next();
    // process events
}
```

### Step 3: Disable XML External Entity (XXE) processing

Another common issue while dealing with large XML files is the danger of XML External Entity (XXE) attacks. It is crucial to disable DTDs (DOCTYPE declarations) in the XML file to prevent XXE attacks.

```java
// Java code
DocumentBuilderFactory dbf = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();

// Disable DTDs
dbf.setFeature("http://apache.org/xml/features/disallow-doctype-decl", true);

// If you can't completely disable DTDs, at least disallow inline DTDs.
dbf.setFeature("http://apache.org/xml/features/nonvalidating/load-external-dtd", false);
```
