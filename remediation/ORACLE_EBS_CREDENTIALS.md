# Remediation for ORACLE_EBS_CREDENTIALS

## Remediation Steps for Oracle EBS Credentials Disclosure

The disclosure of Oracle EBS (E-Business Suite) credentials can lead to unauthorized access and potential compromise of critical business operations. Here are some remediation steps to address this issue:

### Step 1: Change Default Passwords
Oracle EBS comes with default users and passwords. These should be changed immediately after installation.

```sql
alter user [username] identified by [new password];
```

### Step 2: Enable Database Auditing
Oracle provides a built-in database auditing feature. This can help detect and respond to security incidents.

```sql
audit all by [username] by access;
audit system by [username] by access;
```

### Step 3: Enable SSL/TLS for Connections
Secure the information exchange between the client and the server using SSL/TLS.

```bash
orapki wallet create -wallet /etc/ORACLE/WALLETS/[your_wallet_name] -pwd [your_wallet_password] -auto_login_local
orapki wallet add -wallet /etc/ORACLE/WALLETS/[your_wallet_name] -dn CN=[your_server_name] -keysize 2048 -pwd [your_wallet_password]
orapki wallet export -wallet /etc/ORACLE/WALLETS/[your_wallet_name] -dn CN=[your_server_name] -cert /etc/ORACLE/WALLETS/[your_wallet_name]/[server_cert_name] -pwd [your_wallet_password]
```

### Step 4: Regularly Update Oracle EBS
Regular updates can fix known vulnerabilities and improve overall security.

```bash
opatch lsinventory
opatch apply
```

### Step 5: Least Privilege Principle
Only provide necessary privileges to each user, preventing unnecessary access to sensitive data.

```sql
revoke all privileges from [username];
grant [required_privileges] to [username];
```

### Step 6: Encrypt Sensitive Data
Store sensitive data (like passwords, personal identifiable information, etc.) in an encrypted form.

```sql
DBMS_CRYPTO.ENCRYPT(
    src => UTL_I18N.STRING_TO_RAW('[data_to_encrypt]', 'AL32UTF8'),
    typ => DBMS_CRYPTO.ENCRYPT_AES128 + DBMS_CRYPTO.CHAIN_CBC,
    key => UTL_I18N.STRING_TO_RAW('[encryption_key]', 'AL32UTF8'),
);
```

Hope these steps will guide you to secure your Oracle EBS.
