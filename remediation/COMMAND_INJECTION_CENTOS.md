## Remediation Steps for Command Injection in CentOS

Command injection is a form of security vulnerability that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the host operating system via a vulnerable application. This may happen through application areas that accept user input in order to use them in system specific operations.

### Step 1: Avoid Executing User Input

Avoid executing commands that get parameters from user input. If it's inevitable, make sure to sanitize and validate incoming data. This is best practice and a first line of defense against command injection attacks.

Here is an example in Python:

```python
import shlex
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE

def sanitised_system_call(user_input):
    # sanitize user input
    safe_user_input = shlex.quote(user_input)
    command = f"system_specific_operation {safe_user_input}"
    process = Popen(command, shell=True, stdout=PIPE, stderr=PIPE)
    return process.communicate()
```

### Step 2: Use Safer Functions

If possible, use safer functions that don't allow execution of arbitrary commands. Here is an example moving from `os.system` (unsafe) to `subprocess.run` (safer) in Python:

```python
# Old code, unsafe
os.system(f"some_operation {user_input}")

# New code, safer
import subprocess
subprocess.run(['some_operation', user_input], check=True)
```

### Step 3: Update and Patch Frequently

Ensure that all system components are regularly updated and patched. Many vulnerabilities, including command injection ones, are often covered by patches and updates from the vendors.

```bash
sudo yum update
```
