# Remediation for APACHE_TIKA_HEADER_COMMAND_INJECTION

## Remediation Steps for Apache Tika Header Command Injection

The Apache Tika Header Command Injection is a security vulnerability which, if exploited, could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary system commands through HTTP headers.

Remediation involves implementing proper input validation on headers and updating vulnerable versions of Apache Tika.

### Step 1: Update the Apache Tika Library

Upgrade to a version of Apache Tika library that has patched this vulnerability. Currently, versions 1.17 or later are safe to use. This could be done through maven with the following code:

```xml
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.tika</groupId>
    <artifactId>tika-core</artifactId>
    <version>1.17</version> <!-- use latest version */
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

### Step 2: Validate HTTP Headers

Create a function to validate incoming HTTP headers and reject requests with suspicious or malformed headers. An example in Java would be:

```java
private boolean isValidHeader(String headerValue) {
  String safePattern = "^[a-zA-Z0-9\\-\\s]*$";
  return headerValue.matches(safePattern);
}
```
Then use it as follows:

```java
for (Enumeration<String> e = request.getHeaders(); e.hasMoreElements();) {
  String headerValue = e.nextElement();
  if (!isValidHeader(headerValue)) {
    throw new ServletException("Invalid header value in the request");
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Regularly audit and update

To ensure the security of your system, take the time to perform a regular audit of your dependencies and apply updates as they are available.

Also, be sure to follow best practices for secure coding and application security overall. This involves proper input validation, least privilege principles, ensuring confidentiality with encryption, and maintaining integrity and availability of the application.

Remember, preventing command injections should be considered a high priority in your security strategy. Always sanitize user input and never trust incoming data implicitly. This holds true whether it's an HTTP header, a form submission, an API call, or anything else.
