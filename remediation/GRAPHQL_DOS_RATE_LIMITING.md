# Remediation for GRAPHQL_DOS_RATE_LIMITING

## Remediation Steps for Denial of Service Test on GraphQL API
A Denial of Service (DoS) attack on GraphQL API can result in server overload due to repeated requests and can disrupt your services. To avoid this, you can implement rate limiting.

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
You'll need a few npm packages for this solution, you can run the below lines of code to install them:
```bash
npm install express express-graphql graphql-rate-limit
```

### Step 2: Set Up Rate Limiter
Use `graphql-rate-limit` package which provides a custom GraphQL directive you can use to limit the number of requests a client can make to a field.

```javascript
const rateLimit = require('graphql-rate-limit')
const { makeExecutableSchema } = require('graphql-tools')

const typeDefs = `
  directive @rateLimit(max: Int, window: String) on FIELD_DEFINITION

  type Query {
    myField: String @rateLimit(max: 5, window: "1m")
  }
`

const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    myField: () => 'Hello, world!'
  }
}

const schema = makeExecutableSchema({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
  schemaDirectives: {
    rateLimit: rateLimit({
      identityArgs: ['ip'],
      max: 5,
      window: '1m'
    })
  }
}). 
``` 

### Step 3: Create GraphQL Server with Express-GraphQL
Create an Express server that uses the Express-GraphQL middleware to serve your GraphQL API.

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const { graphqlHTTP } = require('express-graphql');
const app = express();

app.use('/graphql', graphqlHTTP({
  schema: schema,
  graphiql: true,
}));

app.listen(4000);
console.log('Running a GraphQL API server at http://localhost:4000/graphql');
```

### Step 4: Test Rate Limiting
You can then test that the rate limiting is working by hitting your `/graphql` endpoint and it should start limiting requests after 5 attempts in 1 minute for each field. 

Please note that this approach provides simple rate limiting at the API level and isn't a comprehensive security solution. For more complex applications, you might need to use a combination of techniques including caching, load balancing, and using a real-time updating rate limiting system like Redis.
