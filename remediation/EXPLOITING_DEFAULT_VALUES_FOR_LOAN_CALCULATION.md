# Remediation for EXPLOITING_DEFAULT_VALUES_FOR_LOAN_CALCULATION

## Remediation Steps for Exploiting Default Values for Loan Calculation

Loan calculations exploitation through default values is a serious security issue. This potential vulnerability may lead to incorrect loan distribution or illegal access to funds. Hence, it is important to validate and secure all input data related to loan calculations.

### Step 1: Validate Input Fields

The first line of defense is input data validation. Ensure that all input fields used for loan calculation are validated - meaning they don't accept values that are inappropriate or could cause issues.

For example, in Python you could use something like this:

```python
def validate_input(input):
  if not isinstance(input, int) or input <= 0:
    raise ValueError('Invalid input for loan calculation')
```

### Step 2: Avoid Using Default Values

Always require and check the loan-relevant details before processing loan calculations. Avoid using defaults.

For Java, it might look like this:

```java
public class LoanDetails {
  private Double principal;
  private Double interest;
  private Integer term;

  public LoanDetails(Double principal, Double interest, Integer term) {
    if (principal == null || interest == null || term == null) {
      throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid loan details");
    }
    this.principal = principal;
    this.interest = interest;
    this.term = term;
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Minimize Privilege for Database Access

Limiting the privilege of the database account can help prevent unauthorized modifications:

```sql
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON loans TO 'user'@'localhost';
```

### Step 4: Regular Auditing and Updating

Regularly review the codes and update the validation rules regularly to ensure better security. 

```bash
git pull origin master
```

These steps will make the loan calculation more secure and minimize the chances of exploitation of default values.
