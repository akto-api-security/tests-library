## Remediation Steps for Exploiting BOLA (Broken Object Level Authorization) by Replacing URL Path with User IDs for Unauthorized Access

Exploiting BOLA by replacing URL path with User IDs is a critical security flaw. Attackers utilize this flaw to gain unauthorized access and perform various high-level unapproved operations. 

### Step 1: Validate User Access

Firstly, validate that the user has the necessary access rights for the requested objects. In most cases, this would involve checking the user's ownership or assigned roles against the inquired Object Id. Here is an example in Python:

```python
def check_user_access(user, objectId):
    # Fetch object from the database
    object = fetch_object_from_db(objectId)
    # Check if user has access to object
    if user.id != object.owner_id:
        raise Forbidden("You don't have access to this object")
    return object
```

### Step 2: Avoid Direct Object References

Minimize vulnerabilities by avoiding the exposure of direct object references in the API endpoints. Instead, use indirect references that are mapped to the associated objects in the server-side. Here's a Java example of associating an indirect reference with an object:

```java
public class UserSession {
    private Map<String, User> userMap = new HashMap<>();
    
    public String createUserSession(User user) {
        String referenceId = UUID.randomUUID().toString();
        userMap.put(referenceId, user);
        return referenceId;
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Implement Proper Access Control Mechanisms

Ensure proper access control mechanisms are in place. Restrict URL access based on user roles. For instance, the `Spring Security` framework provides easy integration for role-based URL restriction in Java.

```java
http
    .authorizeRequests()
    .antMatchers("/admin/**").hasRole("ADMIN")
    .and()
    .formLogin();
```
