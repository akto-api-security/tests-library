# Remediation for SOURCE_CODE_DISCLOSURE_SVN

## Remediation Steps for Source Code Disclosure Using SVN

Source Code Disclosure using SVN poses a significant security risk as it allows unauthorized access to the source code, potentially exposing sensitive information or system vulnerabilities.

### Step 1: Disable .svn Directory Access
Most source code disclosures occur because the `.svn` directory is accessible. The .svn directory contains a lot of metadata about your code and your repository that can be used maliciously if accessed. Use a .htaccess file to disable access to all .svn directories.

```bash
# create .htaccess file with the following content
echo "RewriteEngine on" > .htaccess
echo "RewriteRule \.svn/ - [F,L]" >> .htaccess
```

### Step 2: Remove .svn Folders from the Publicly Accessible Area 
To remediate the problem completely, you should ensure that .svn folders do not exist in your webroot or any subdirectories. 

```bash
# find and delete all .svn directories recursively
find /path/to/your/webroot -name .svn -type d -print0 | xargs -0 rm -rf
```

### Step 3: Proper Server Configuration
Ensure your web server is not configured to serve hidden directories (.svn/).

If you are using Apache, use the below configurations:

```apacheconf
<DirectoryMatch "^/.*/\.svn/">
    Order deny,allow
    Deny from all
</DirectoryMatch>
```

### Step 4: Review and Update Regularly
Regularly review your source code and server configurations to make sure there are no .svn folders in your publicly accessible area.

## Note
This will not protect against developers accidentally committing sensitive data in other parts of the code. Remember to always keep sensitive data out of your version control repositories.
