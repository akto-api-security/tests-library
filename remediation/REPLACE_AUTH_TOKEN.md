# Remediation for REPLACE_AUTH_TOKEN

## Remediation Steps for Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA) by Changing Auth Token

Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA) vulnerability can lead to unauthorized access to user data and other sensitive information. The following steps, with Java Spring Boot code snippets, can help remediate this security issue in your application.

### Step 1: Identification of BOLA

Before any remediation happens, you should be able to identify where BOLA vulnerabilities exist in your application. They mostly happen when the backend API uses input from the client side to retrieve objects directly.

### Step 2: Implement Input Validation

Perform input validation to make sure that the user is allowed to act on the object thatâ€™s in question.

```java
if (user.getId() != request.getUserId()) {
    throw new UnauthorizedAccessException("User is not authorized to access this resource.");
}
```

### Step 3: Implement Access Control

Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) or Access Control List (ACL) to confirm user permissions before allowing them to perform actions on objects.

```java
// Using Spring Security for RBAC
@PreAuthorize("hasRole('ROLE_ADMIN')")
public ResponseEntity<?> getUser(Long id) {
    // code to get user
}
```

### Step 4: Association of Every Object with a User

Every object in the database should be associated with a user. Only allow token if the user ID in token matches the user ID associated with the object.

```java
if (token.getUser().getId() == object.getUser().getId()) {
    // Allow action
}
```
