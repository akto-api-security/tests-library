# Remediation for BOLA_URL_INSERT_API_VERSION_PATCH

## Remediation Steps for Exploiting BOLA (Broken Object Level Authorization) through API Version IDs in URL Path

BOLA exploits involve manipulating object references in URL paths to circumvent secure access controls, potentially leading to unauthorized access of sensitive data. Here are some remediation steps to help prevent this type of vulnerability.

### Step 1: Enforce Authorization Checks

Do not solely rely on user ownership for access. For each incoming request, you should ensure that the proper authorization checks are in place.

```javascript
app.put('/api/version/:id', (req, res) => {
  // check authorization
  if (req.user.id != req.params.id) {
    return res.status(403).send("Unauthorized access");
  }
  
  // perform API operation
});
```

### Step 2: Randomize Resource Identifiers

One way to deter BOLA is to randomize or hash your resource identifiers, making it challenging for attackers to guess the IDs of resources they shouldn't have access to.

```javascript
const crypto = require('crypto');

function generateId() {
  // generate a random object id 
  return crypto.randomBytes(16).toString('hex');
}
```

### Step 3: Rate Limiting

Apply rate limiting to your API endpoints to prevent mass attempts to guess resource identifiers.

For example, using an Express middleware like `express-rate-limit`

```javascript
const expressRateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');

const apiLimiter = expressRateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 100, // Limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
  message: 'Too many requests, please try again later.'
});

app.put('/api/version/:id', apiLimiter, (req, res) => {
  // perform API operation
});

``` 

### Step 4: Regular Auditing and Updating

Review your APIs regularly. It is crucial to keep your API documentation up to date and conduct regular API security audits.

```bash
npm audit
```

In addition to these steps, ensure other security measures like HTTPS, JWT tokens, etc., are used to secure your APIs further. Maintain a secure, hash/salted mapping table for object IDs to mitigate the risk of BOLA.
