## Remediation Steps for Sensitive Square OAUTH Secret Exposure
Sensitive data exposure, particularly of Square OAuth secrets, can lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of Square resources. Therefore, it's crucial to secure these secrets to ensure data integrity and confidentiality.

### Step 1: Regenerate and Secure SQUARE OAUTH SECRET
Rotate your OAUTH secrets periodically and securely store them using a secrets manager. Also, ensure your application doesn't log these secrets.

```python
# Python language using boto3 to access AWS Secret Manager
import boto3

def get_secret():
    secret_name = "MySecretName"
    region_name = "YourAWSCloudRegion"

    # Create a Secrets Manager client
    session = boto3.session.Session()
    client = session.client(
        service_name='secretsmanager',
        region_name=region_name
    )

    # In this sample we only handle the specific exceptions for the 'GetSecretValue' API.
    get_secret_value_response = client.get_secret_value(SecretId=secret_name)
    return get_secret_value_response['SecretString']
```

### Step 2: Avoid Hardcoding SQUARE OAUTH SECRET in Code
Never hardcode secrets in your source code. Instead, use a configuration file that is not checked into your version control system, or better, use environment variables or a secure secret management system like AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, or Google Secret Manager.

```python
# Python language using os to access environment variables
import os

def get_oauth_secret():
    return os.getenv('SQUARE_OAUTH_SECRET')
```

### Step 3: Restrict SQUARE OAUTH SECRET Access
Only privileged users or applications should have access to this secret. Configure your operating system or secret management system to restrict access to this data.

```bash
# Bash script to restrict file access
chmod 600 /path/to/your/configuration.conf
```

### Step 4: Enable Encryption during Transit and at Rest
Ensure secure communication using HTTPS and store your secrets in encrypted form, preferably using a secrets management system.

```bash
# OpenSSL command to encrypt file containing OAUTH secret
openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -salt -in secrets.conf -out secrets.conf.enc
```
