## Remediation Steps for Improper Page Size Handling

Improper page size handling can be a vulnerability that can lead to a potential Denial of Service (DoS) attack or an information leak. A large amount of data requested with a large page size could cause performance issues or even a system crash. Therefore, it is important to validate and limit the page size in your application.

Most common attack occurs where the server allows a client to determine the size or number of resources requested. An attacker can request for large number of resources, quickly filling up the server's memory and potentially causing it to crash.

### Step 1: Limit the Page Size

You should put a cap on the maximum page size the client can request. A reasonable default might be 100.

Here is an example of validating and limiting the page size using Java:

```java
public class PageRequest {
    private static final int MAX_PAGE_SIZE = 100;
    
    private int page;
    private int size;

    public void setSize(int size) {
        if (size > MAX_PAGE_SIZE) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Page size must not exceed " + MAX_PAGE_SIZE);
        }
        
        this.size = size;
    }
}
```
In this example, `setSize(int size)` method will throw an `IllegalArgumentException` if the page size exceeds the maximum limit.

### Step 2: Provide a Default Page Size

If a client doesn't specify a page size, you should use a default. Again, a reasonable default might be 100.

```java
public class PageRequest {
    private static final int DEFAULT_PAGE_SIZE = 100;
    
    private int page;
    private int size = DEFAULT_PAGE_SIZE;

    // ... rest of your code ...
}
```

### Step 3: Return a Detailed Error Message

If a client requests a page size that's too large, return a `400 BAD REQUEST` status code along with a detailed error message.

```java
public class PageRequest {
    
    // ... rest of your code ...

    public void setSize(int size) {
        if (size > MAX_PAGE_SIZE) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Page size must not exceed " + MAX_PAGE_SIZE);
        }
        
        this.size = size;
    }
}
```
