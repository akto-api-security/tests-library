## Remediation Steps for BOLA through User ID Fuzzing for DELETE method APIs

BOLA (Broken Object Level Authorization) through User ID Fuzzing is a serious security issue that allows unauthorized access to sensitive user data. This vulnerability can be exploited by attackers to delete user data via APIs. To fix this vulnerability, the API endpoints should be properly secured by implementing proper authorization checks and validating user permissions.

### Step 1: Implement Server-Side Authorization Checks

First, every DELETE method API request should be validated server-side to ensure that the authenticated user has the appropriate permissions to delete the targeted data.

```javascript
app.delete('/api/user/:id', (req, res) => {
    let authenticatedUser = getAuthenticatedUser(req);
    let targetUser = getUser(req.params.id);
    
    if (!authenticatedUser || !targetUser) {
        // User not authenticated or user not found
        return res.status(401).send();
    }
    
    if (authenticatedUser.id !== targetUser.id) {
        // Authenticated user doesn't have the permission to delete the target user
        return res.status(403).send();
    }

    // Proceed with deletion
    deleteUser(targetUser);
});
```
### Step 2: Validate and Sanitize User Input 

These checks should be extended to include any user inputs that serve as parameters to the 'delete' endpoint. This will help mitigate the risk of User ID fuzzing.

```javascript
app.delete('/api/user/:id', (req, res) => {
    // Validate and sanitize the input
    let userId = sanitizeInput(req.params.id);
    
    if (!validateUserId(userId)) {
        // Invalid user ID
        return res.status(400).send();
    }
});
```
