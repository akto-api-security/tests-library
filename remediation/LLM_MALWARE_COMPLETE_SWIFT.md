# Remediation for LLM_MALWARE_COMPLETE_SWIFT

## Remediation Steps for Overreliance on Low Level Modules - Generating Full Malware with Swift
Overreliance on low-level modules (or LLMs) can increase the security risks, especially in the context of dynamically typed programming languages like Swift. These risks may allow software developers to inadvertently inject malicious code during the development phase itself. 

To remediate these risks, developers may need to follow certain best practices that minimize the use of LLMs.

### Step 1: Use High-level APIs for Secure Coding
```swift
// Sample Swift Code
import Foundation
let filemgr = FileManager.default
let dirPaths = filemgr.urls(for: .documentDirectory, in: .userDomainMask)
let docsURL = dirPaths[0]
let newDir = docsURL.appendingPathComponent("/Data")
do {
    try filemgr.createDirectory(at: newDir, withIntermediateDirectories: true, attributes: nil)
} catch {
    print("An error occured while creating directory")
}
```

### Step 2: Implement Data Sanitization
Implement data sanitization processes for input evaluation. Make sure to validate, sanitize, and escape untrusted data.

```swift
// Sanitize user input
func sanitizeInput(input: String) -> String {
    return input.trimmingCharacters(in: .whitespacesAndNewlines)
}
```

### Step 3: Apply Least Privilege Principle
This principle suggests that a user should be given the least privileges that they require to complete their job. 

```swift
import Security

let flags: SecAccessControlCreateFlags = [.userPresence, .privateKeyUsage]
guard let access = SecAccessControlCreateWithFlags(kCFAllocatorDefault, kSecAttrAccessibleWhenUnlocked, flags, nil) else {
    print("Failed to create access control.")
    return
}

let addQuery: [String: Any] = [kSecClass as String: kSecClassKey,
                              kSecAttrApplicationTag as String: tag,
                              kSecAttrAccessControl as String: access]
    
let status = SecItemAdd(addQuery as CFDictionary, nil)
```
