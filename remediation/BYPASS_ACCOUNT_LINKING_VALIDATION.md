# Remediation for BYPASS_ACCOUNT_LINKING_VALIDATION

## Remediation Steps for Bypass Account Linking Validation
Bypassing Account Linking Validation is a serious security vulnerability. It can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access, potentially compromising sensitive information or performing unauthorized actions. 

Proper account validation is a critical security measure that should not be circumvented.

### Step 1: Add Necessary Validation Checks 

Firstly, adding necessary validation checks on the server side is one mandatory procedure that cannot be skipped.

Consider the following example in Python using the Django Web Framework:

```python
# example in Django
from django.core.exceptions import ValidationError

def clean(self):
    # Run the standard clean method first
    super().clean()

    if not self.is_link_valid(): # your custom validation method
        raise ValidationError("Invalid Link!")
```
This would throw a validation error when the link is not valid.

### Step 2: Implement Account Linking

It's highly recommended to implement the official account linking procedure offered by the platform.

For instance, here is how you do it with Facebook Login:

```javascript
// JavaScript example using Facebook SDK

FB.login(function(response) {
    if (response.authResponse) {
        FB.api('/me', function(response) {
            console.log('Good to see you, ' + response.name + '.');
        });
    } else {
        console.log('User cancelled login or did not fully authorize.');
    }
}, {scope: 'public_profile,email', auth_type: 'rerequest'});
```
This JavaScript code will send a new request for authorization if the user has declined any of the requested permissions.

### Step 3: Encrypt Sensitive Data

It's crucial to secure the transmission of sensitive data by using encryption. Make sure encryption is used when storing sensitive data in the database and transmitting over the network.

```java
// Java code snippet for encryption using AES

Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding");
cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, secretkey);
byte[] cipherText = cipher.doFinal(plainText.getBytes("UTF8"));
String encryptedText = new String(Base64.encodeBase64(cipherText),"UTF-8");
```
