## Remediation Steps for Bypassing Basic Auth Using Weak Passwords
Bypassing Basic Auth using weak passwords is a severe security issue that can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users, potentially leading to a full-scale data breach.

### Step 1: Enforce Strong Password Policies
Implement strong policies for password complexity to make sure the passwords are not easily guessable. This can be implemented at the client level (UI) or the server level.

```python
import re

def check_password_strength(password):
    # At least 8 characters
    if len(password) < 8:
        return False
    # Contains a number
    if not re.search('[0-9]', password):
        return False
    # Contains an uppercase letter
    if not re.search('[A-Z]', password):
        return False
    # Contains a lowercase letter
    if not re.search('[a-z]', password):
        return False
    # Contains a special character
    if not re.search('[^A-Za-z0-9]', password):
        return False
    return True
```

### Step 2: Use Password Hashing
Stored passwords should be hashed and salted to ensure their security. This helps protect the passwords even if the storage itself is breached.

```python
import hashlib
import os

def hash_password(password):
    salt = os.urandom(32)
    hash_value = hashlib.sha256(salt + password.encode('utf-8')).hexdigest()
    return (salt + hash_value.encode('utf-8')).hexdigest()
```

### Step 3: Implement Account Lockouts
When a user repeatedly attempts to login with the wrong password, consider locking the account for a certain period. This will prevent automated brute-force attacks.

```python
MAX_ATTEMPTS = 3
LOCKOUT_DURATION = 30 # in minutes

def authenticate_user(username, password):
    attempts = get_attempts(username)
    if attempts > MAX_ATTEMPTS:
        lock_time = get_lockout_time(username)
        if current_time() < lock_time + LOCKOUT_DURATION:
            return False 
        else:
            reset_attempts(username)
    if authenticate(username, password):
        reset_attempts(username)
        return True 
    else:
        increment_attempts(username)
```

### Step 4: Use Multi-Factor Authentication
Introduce additional layers of authentication such as device verification, biometrics, or OTPs. This can help prevent unauthorized access even if the password is compromised.

Please explore existing libraries, frameworks, or services for implementation as per your project specifics. 

These steps, when combines, can significantly bolster the security of your authentication system against weak password exploits. Regular audits and updates are also crucial to maintaining this security.
