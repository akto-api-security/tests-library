## Remediation Steps for Exposed Redis

Exposed Redis instances can be a serious security problem. If not properly configured or secured, Redis can serve sensitive information to unauthenticated users. This can lead to data breaches or the compromise of sensitive data.

### Step 1: Configure Redis to Require a Password
To configure Redis to require a password, you need to modify your Redis configuration file.

Bash commands for modifying Redis configuration:

```bash
sudo vim /etc/redis/redis.conf
```

In the configuration file, uncomment (or add) and modify the following line:

```shell
requirepass your_password_here
```

Where 'your_password_here' is a strong, unique password.

### Step 2: Restart Redis to Apply Changes

After setting up a password in the configuration file, the Redis service needs to be restarted for the new settings to take effect.

Use this bash command:

```bash
sudo service redis-server restart
```

### Step 3: Firewall Configuration 

If your Redis instance is not supposed to be publicly available, blocking unwanted traffic using firewall would prevent unauthorized access:

```bash
sudo ufw deny from any to any port 6379
```

### Step 4: Enable TLS in Redis (Optional)

```
Note: This step is optional and requires Redis 6.0 or newer version.
```

If you have a Redis version that supports SSL/TLS natively (6.0 or greater), create or use existing SSL certificates and keys, and then add these lines to your configuration file:

```shell
tls-port 6379
tls-cert-file /etc/redis/ssl/redis.crt
tls-key-file /etc/redis/ssl/redis.key
```

Then restart Redis to apply changes:

```bash
sudo service redis-server restart
```
