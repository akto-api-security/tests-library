# Remediation for TIME_BASED_SQLI_XSS_GET

## Remediation Steps for Time Based SQL Injection With XSS for GET Method APIs
Time-Based SQL Injection with Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a significant security issue for your API. Your application could be vulnerable to hackers who could steal data, perform actions on behalf of your users, and potentially gain full control of your systems. 

### Step 1: Use Parameterized Queries or Prepared Statements
Using parameterized queries or prepared statements can effectively prevent SQL injection attacks. Here's how to do it in Java with JDBC:
```java
String custname = request.getParameter("customerName"); // This should REALLY be validated
try {
    Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost/test?" + "user=minty&password=greatsqldb");

    String query = "SELECT account_balance WHERE customer_name = ?";
    PreparedStatement pstmt = conn.prepareStatement(query);
    pstmt.setString(1, custname);
    ResultSet results = pstmt.executeQuery(query);
} catch (SQLException se) {
    // handle the error
}
```
### Step 2: Sanitize User Inputs for XSS
You should sanitize all user inputs to prevent XSS attacks. You can use built-in libraries or create your own functions for doing this. Please see this example for JavaScript:
```javascript
function sanitizeInput(str) {
    str = str.replace(/&/g, '&amp;');
    str = str.replace(/</g, '&lt;');
    str = str.replace(/>/g, '&gt;');
    str = str.replace(/"/g, '&quot;');
    str = str.replace(/'/g, '&#x27;');
    str = str.replace(/\//g, '&#x2F;');
    return str;
}
```
### Step 3: Encode Output Display Data
To prevent stored XSS, always encode data that you output back to the browser. As an example, in a PHP context:
```php
echo htmlentities($userInput, ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8');
```
### Step 4: Use Appropriate HTTP methods
Avoid sending sensitive data using the GET method, as it will be logged in various places like browser history, server logs, etc.


### Step 5: Implement a Content Security Policy
A Content Security Policy (CSP) is an added layer of security that helps to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks. This is a type of validation that can be implemented at the server level as:
```bash
Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'self' https://apis.google.com
```
