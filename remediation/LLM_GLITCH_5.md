## Remediation Steps for Overreliance Test on LLMs - Glitch Test with Random Word

An overreliance on low-level modules (LLMs) during a Glitch Test with Random Word can result in misinterpreted test results or security gaps. To avoid these issues, it's important to diversify your testing protocols and ensure higher-level modules (HLMs) are also considered. 

### Step 1: Adjust Testing Procedures
Ensure that your testing strategy isn't exclusively reliant on LLMs. Ensuring a comprehensive testing approach by also incorporating HLMs will reduce the overreliance on LLMs.  

```bash
# No specific source code as it depends on the context and testing tools
```

### Step 2: Enhance Security Measures
Take a proactive approach to security. Regularly audit your codebase, and use multiple security measures like encryption, secure protocols for data communication, and input validation. These actions will help minimize the risks involved with glitches.

```bash
# No specific source code as it depends on the context and security tools
```

### Step 3: Adequate Error Handling
Ensure all tests, especially those involving LLMs, have adequate error handling in place. This will aid in identifying and informing about any glitches that occur.

```python
try:
    # Execute your code that could raise an exception
except Exception as e:
    # Handle your exception
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```
