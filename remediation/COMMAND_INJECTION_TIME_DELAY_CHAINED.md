# Remediation for COMMAND_INJECTION_TIME_DELAY_CHAINED

## Remediation Steps for Command Injection using Time Delay Sleep Command

Command Injection is a serious security issue, where an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the host OS, resulting in unauthorized system data handling. In this case, using a time delay sleep command increases the potential for malicious activities. 

The remediation steps are provided in the context of a web application implemented in Node.js, as it's frequently subject to these types of vulnerability.

### Step 1: Avoid Direct Use of Shell Functions 
In Node.js, avoid using functions that can invoke shell commands directly such as `exec()`, `execFile()`, `spawn()`, `spawnSync()`.
```javascript
// Avoid using
const { exec } = require('child_process');
exec(userInput, (error, stdout, stderr) => { /* ... */ });
```

### Step 2: Use Safe Alternatives or Sanitize Inputs
Stick to functions that execute file directly and cannot perform command chaining.
If you must use dangerous functions, make sure to sanitize the user inputs.

```javascript
const userInput = /* ... */;
// Use safe methods
const { execFile } = require('child_process');
execFile('ls', ['-l', userInput], (error, stdout, stderr) => { /* ... */ });

// Or sanitize inputs
const sanitizedUserInput = userInput.replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9-_]/g, '');
exec(`ls -l ${sanitizedUserInput}`, (error, stdout, stderr) => { /* ... */ });
```
