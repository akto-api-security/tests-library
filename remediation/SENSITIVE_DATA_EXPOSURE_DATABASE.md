# Remediation for SENSITIVE_DATA_EXPOSURE_DATABASE

## Remediation Steps for Sensitive Data Exposure for Database
Sensitive data exposure for databases is a significant security concern. Without proper security measures in place, attackers can gain unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in databases. Here, we'll demonstrate how to secure a MySQL database, but the general principles are applicable to most databases.

### Step 1: Use Strong Passwords for Database Accounts
```sql
ALTER USER 'username'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'New-Strong-Password!';
```

### Step 2: Limit Access Rights for Each User Account
Assign minimum necessary rights to each user account.
```sql
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, DELETE ON database_name.* TO 'username'@'host';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

### Step 3: Enable Database Encryption
It's crucial to encrypt data stored in your database. MySQL supports data-at-rest encryption.
```bash
# Add to my.cnf then restart MySQL Server
echo "[mysqld]
encrypt_binlog=ON
master_verify_checksum=ON
binlog_checksum=CRC32
log_bin=binlog
log_slave_updates
binlog_format=ROW
innodb_encrypt_tables=ON
innodb_encrypt_log=ON
" >> /etc/mysql/my.cnf
systemctl restart mysql
```


### Step 4: Regularly Backup Your Database
Regular backups will help you to quickly recover from data breaches.
```bash
mysqldump -u username -p database_name > backup.sql
```

### Step 5: Monitor Database Activity
Set up monitoring to detect and respond to suspicious activities. You can use tools like MySQL Enterprise Monitor or VividCortex for this.
