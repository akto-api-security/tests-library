## Remediation Steps for Azure Function Key URL Sensitive Data Exposure
Sensitive data exposure through Azure Function Key URL is a critical security issue. If an attacker gains unauthorized access to the function key, they can effectively compromise the function and gain access to the underlying resources.

### Step 1: Do not expose Function Key in the URL
Make sure that your Function Key is not exposed in the URL, as URLs are often logged or can be tracked. Instead, use a secure method to store and access these keys such as Azure Key Vault.

### Step 2: Use Azure Key Vault
Set up and use Azure Key Vault to securely store the Function Key. Azure Key Vault provides a secure way to manage and safeguard keys.

```csharp
using Microsoft.Azure.KeyVault;
using Microsoft.Azure.Services.AppAuthentication;

var azureServiceTokenProvider = new AzureServiceTokenProvider();
var keyVaultClient = new KeyVaultClient(new KeyVaultClient.AuthenticationCallback(azureServiceTokenProvider.KeyVaultTokenCallback));

// Retrieve the secret from Azure Key Vault
var secret = await keyVaultClient.GetSecretAsync("https://<YourVaultName>.vault.azure.net/secrets/<YourSecretName>").ConfigureAwait(false);

// You can now use the secret.Value in the rest of your function
```

### Step 3: Remove any hardcoded keys
Ensure there are no hard-coded secrets in your code. Instead, leverage the Azure managed identities to securely access resources such as Azure functions.

```csharp
public static class EnvironmentSettingConfigurator
{
   public static string GetEnvironmentVariable(string name)
   {
      return Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable(name, EnvironmentVariableTarget.Process);
   }
}
```

### Step 4: Rotating your Function Keys
In case a key gets exposed, you should rotate your Function Key to minimize the impact. 

```csharp
public static async Task<HttpResponseMessage> Run(HttpRequestMessage req, TraceWriter log)
{
    var client = new HttpClient();
    var request = new HttpRequestMessage(HttpMethod.Put, "https://<yourapp>.azurewebsites.net/admin/functions/<functionKeyName>/keys/default?code=<masterkey>");

    var response = await client.SendAsync(request);
    var key = await response.Content.ReadAsAsync<FunctionKey>();

    return req.CreateResponse(HttpStatusCode.OK, "The new key is: " + key.value);
}

public class FunctionKey
{
    public string name { get; set; }
    public string value { get; set; }
}
```
Ensure the regular monitoring of function logs for any unauthorized access and always update keys regularly with strong and unique values for each function.
