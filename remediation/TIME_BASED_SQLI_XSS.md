# Remediation for TIME_BASED_SQLI_XSS

## Remediation Steps for Time based SQL Injection Test with XSS

Time-based SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) are common security vulnerabilities. This issue occurs when the application is not properly sanitizing user inputs and creating SQL queries dynamically. Here are the steps to mitigate these vulnerabilities:

### Step 1: Use Prepared Statements or Parameterized Queries

Most programming languages provide the ability to use prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection, This ensures that attackers can't inject malicious SQL code into your queries. Below is an example in PHP.

```php
$stmt = $dbh->prepare("INSERT INTO Customers (FirstName, LastName) VALUES (:firstname, :lastname)");
$stmt->bindParam(':firstname', $firstname);
$stmt->bindParam(':lastname', $lastname);

$firstname = 'John';
$lastname = 'Doe';
$stmt->execute();
```

### Step 2: Use Safe APIs

Some APIs safely abstract SQL queries and prevent SQL injection by default like libraries/ORM such as Hibernate, SQLAlchemy. Make sure to use these wherever possible.

### Step 3: Sanitize User Input

Always sanitize user input to prevent XSS attacks. Most web frameworks provide methods to sanitize user input. Here's how to do this in JavaScript.

```javascript
var userInput = "<script>evil script</script>";
var sanitizedInput = encodeURI(userInput);
```

### Step 4: Use Content Security Policy (CSP)

Implementing Content Security Policy (CSP) headers can significantly reduce the risk and impact of XSS attacks. CSP provides a standard method for websites to declare approved origins of content that browsers should be allowed to load.

```html
<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy"
    content="default-src 'none'; script-src 'self'; connect-src 'self'; img-src 'self'; style-src 'self';">
```

### Step 5: Regular Code Review and Update

Regularly review and update your codebase to ensure that SQL and XSS vulnerabilities are not introduced in the future. Automated security tools can also be incorporated to scan your application for common security vulnerabilities.

Remember, It's always better to prevent vulnerabilities in the first place than trying to fix them later.
