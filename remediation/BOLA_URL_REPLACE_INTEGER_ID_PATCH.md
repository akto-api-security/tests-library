## Remediation Steps for Unauthorized Access Exploiting BOLA with PUT/PATCH based APIs

Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA), also known as Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR), is a serious vulnerability that can allow unauthorized users to access confidential data.

Here's how you can remediate such a vulnerability in a Node.js / Express application using middleware for authorization:

### Step 1: Implementing Middleware for Authorization
Add middleware which will verify the user's access token and determine if they are authorized to make changes to the specific resource.

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();

// Middleware for checking the user's access token
const authenticateUser = (req, res, next) => {
  const token = req.headers['authorization'];

  // Validate the token using your preferred method
  // If token is invalid, return an error
  // If token is valid, attach the user object to the request and proceed

  next();
};

// Apply the middleware to the router
router.use(authenticateUser);
```

### Step 2: Ensuring Correct Object-Level Authorization
Upon receiving a request to modify a resource (PUT/PATCH), verify if the authenticated user has permission to perform the action on the specified resource using object-level checks. 

```javascript
router.put('/resource/:id', (req, res, next) => {
  const userId = req.user.id;
  const resourceId = req.params.id;

  // Check if the user is authorized to modify the resource
  // Example: query the database to verify if this user owns the resource
  // If the user is not authorized, return an error
  // If the user is authorized, proceed to update the resource

  res.send('Resource updated successfully');
});
```
