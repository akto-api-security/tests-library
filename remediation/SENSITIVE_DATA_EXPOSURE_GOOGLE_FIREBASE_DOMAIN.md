## Remediation Steps for Sensitive Data Exposure in Google Firebase Domain

Sensitive data exposure in Google Firebase can put your application at serious risk. The following steps will guide you on how to mitigate this issue.

### Step 1: Protect your Firebase Database
- Start by ensuring that your Firebase database has security rules that prevent unauthorized access.

```json
{
  "rules": {
    ".read": "auth != null",
    ".write": "auth != null"
  }
}
```
This security rule ensures that only authenticated users can read or write to your Firebase database.

### Step 2: Store sensitive data in Firebase Cloud Storage
Instead of storing sensitive data in your Firebase database, you can store it in Firebase Cloud Storage, which has its own set of security rules that offer a finer level of control.

```json
{
  "rules": {
    ".read": "auth != null",
    ".write": "auth != null"
  }
}
```
This security rule also ensures that only authenticated users can read or write to your Firebase Cloud Storage.

### Step 3: Enable SSL in Firebase Hosting
To protect data in transit, consider enabling SSL in Firebase Hosting.
```javascript
var config = {
    apiKey: "<API_KEY>",
    authDomain: "<PROJECT_ID>.firebaseapp.com",
    databaseURL: "https://<DATABASE_NAME>.firebaseio.com",
    storageBucket: "<BUCKET>.appspot.com",
};
firebase.initializeApp(config);
```
On Firebase Hosting, SSL is enabled by default, and cannot be turned off. This is a secure default configuration.
