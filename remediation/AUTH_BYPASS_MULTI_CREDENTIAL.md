# Remediation for AUTH_BYPASS_MULTI_CREDENTIAL

## Remediation Steps for Authentication Bypass by Sending Multiple Credentials in Parameters

Authentication Bypass by sending multiple credentials in parameters is a critical security vulnerability. If parameters can be passed multiple credentials, an attacker may exploit it to bypass authentication mechanisms.

### Step 1: Input Validation
Ensure the application correctly validates the input by only allowing one set of credentials. This can be achieved by implementing an input sanitization function that eliminates extra sets of credentials.

#### In Python:
```python
def sanitize_input(credentials):
    if type(credentials) is not dict or len(credentials) != 2:
        raise ValueError("Invalid credentials format")
    
    if 'username' not in credentials or 'password' not in credentials:
        raise ValueError("Credentials are missing")

    return True
```

#### In JavaScript:
```javascript
function sanitizeInput(credentials) {
    if (typeof credentials !== 'object' || Object.keys(credentials).length !== 2) {
        throw new Error('Invalid credentials format');
    }

    if (!credentials.hasOwnProperty('username') || !credentials.hasOwnProperty('password')) {
        throw new Error('Credentials are missing');
    }

    return true;
}
```

### Step 2: Strong Authentication Mechanism
Ensure the system is implemented with a strong authentication mechanism that won't get bypassed by the repetition of parameters. 

#### In Python:
```python
def authenticate(credentials):
    sanitize_input(credentials)

    username = credentials['username']
    password = credentials['password']

    # authentication code here
```

#### In JavaScript:
```javascript
function authenticate(credentials) {
    sanitizeInput(credentials);

    const { username, password } = credentials;

    // authentication code here
}
```
