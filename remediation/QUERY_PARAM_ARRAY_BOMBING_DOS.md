## Remediation Steps for Denial of Service Test by Bombing Multiple Query Parameter Arrays in Request
A possible way to attempt a Denial of Service (DoS) attack is by bombing multiple query parameter arrays in a request. This can potentially overload the system, rendering it unable to process further requests.

### Step 1: Limit the Number of Request Query Parameters
One way to mitigate this issue is by imposing a limit on the number of query parameters that a single request can contain. This can typically be done in the middleware of your application. 
In NodeJS with Express, this can be done as follows:
```javascript
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  const maxQueryParams = 100;
  if(Object.keys(req.query).length > maxQueryParams) {
    res.status(400).send('Too many query parameters');
  } else {
    next();
  }
});
```
### Step 2: Set Up Rate Limiting
Rate limiting helps defend against DoS attacks by limiting the number of requests that an IP can send in a given time frame.
In NodeJS with Express, this can be done using Express-Rate-Limit package.
```javascript
const rateLimit = require("express-rate-limit");

const limiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 100 // limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
});

app.use(limiter);
```
### Step 3: Use a WAF (Web Application Firewall)
A WAF can provide a more extensive protection, including against DoS attacks. Ensure that your WAF is configured to protect against this type of attack.
