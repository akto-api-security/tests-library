## Remediation Steps for Jetty Stats Exposed

Exposing Jetty stats is a potential security issue, as it can result in unauthorized access to sensitive data. Attackers might exploit stats information to execute well-crafted attacks. 

### Step 1: Disable Stats Handler

The first step is to disable Jetty's StatisticsHandler, which displays server statistics. This is generally accomplished through modification of the jetty.xml configuration file. The following excerpt of code will disable the statistics handler:

```xml
<Get name="handler">
    <Call name="removeHandler">
        <Arg>
            <New class="org.eclipse.jetty.server.handler.StatisticsHandler"/>
        </Arg>
    </Call>
</Get>
```
### Step 2: Limit access to HTTP access logs
Http access logs can provide sensitive information, which can be used by attackers. Limiting access to these logs can provide an extra layer of security.

```bash
chmod 700 /path/to/your/logs
```
### Step 3: Firewall Configuration
Configure the Firewall to accept only trusted connections.

```bash
sudo ufw allow from trusted_ip to any port jetty_port
sudo ufw deny from any to any port jetty_port
```
Replace `trusted_ip` with the IP address you wish to allow and `jetty_port` with your server's Jetty port.
