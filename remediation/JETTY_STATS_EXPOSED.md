# Remediation for JETTY_STATS_EXPOSED

## Remediation Steps for Jetty Stats Exposed

Exposing Jetty stats is a potential security issue, as it can result in unauthorized access to sensitive data. Attackers might exploit stats information to execute well-crafted attacks. 

### Step 1: Disable Stats Handler

The first step is to disable Jetty's StatisticsHandler, which displays server statistics. This is generally accomplished through modification of the jetty.xml configuration file. The following excerpt of code will disable the statistics handler:

```xml
<Get name="handler">
    <Call name="removeHandler">
        <Arg>
            <New class="org.eclipse.jetty.server.handler.StatisticsHandler"/>
        </Arg>
    </Call>
</Get>
```
### Step 2: Limit access to HTTP access logs
Http access logs can provide sensitive information, which can be used by attackers. Limiting access to these logs can provide an extra layer of security.

```bash
chmod 700 /path/to/your/logs
```
### Step 3: Firewall Configuration
Configure the Firewall to accept only trusted connections.

```bash
sudo ufw allow from trusted_ip to any port jetty_port
sudo ufw deny from any to any port jetty_port
```
Replace `trusted_ip` with the IP address you wish to allow and `jetty_port` with your server's Jetty port.

### Step 4: Regular Server Audit

Regularly auditing your Jetty web server for any unusual activity can help prevent potential security tenches.

Consult with your hosting provider or internal IT department on running the audit based on your organization's standard operating procedures.

### Step 5: Update Jetty to the Latest Version

Ensure your Jetty server is updated to the latest stable version. Updates often contain important security patches.

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade jetty9
```
This command assumes you have Jetty installed via the apt package manager and the package's name is jetty9. Your command may vary depending on your environment and how Jetty was installed. Please, verify and adjust accordingly.

### Step 6: Restart Jetty
Finally, restart your Jetty server to enforce all changes:

```bash
sudo service jetty restart
```
Again, your command may vary depending on your system's configuration and how Jetty is installed and run.

## Conclusion

Following these steps will help mitigate the exposure of Jetty stats, solidify your web server, and increase the overall security of your application.
