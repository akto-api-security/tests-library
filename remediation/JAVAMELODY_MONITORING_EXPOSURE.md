## Remediation Steps for JavaMelody Monitoring Exposure

JavaMelody Monitoring Exposure is a serious security issue that can lead to information leak and unauthorized manipulation of application data.
JavaMelody exposes its interfaces to anyone who can access the application URL, potentially allowing hackers access to sensitive monitoring data. 

To mitigate this vulnerability, you should restrict access to the monitoring pages and encrypt your monitoring data.

### Step 1: Restrict Access to the Monitoring Page 

The best way to restrict access to your JavaMelody monitoring page is through your web.xml file. This involves setting security constraints.

```xml
<security-constraint>
    <web-resource-collection>
        <url-pattern>/monitoring</url-pattern>
    </web-resource-collection>
    <auth-constraint>
        <role-name>Admin</role-name>
    </auth-constraint>
</security-constraint>

<login-config>
    <auth-method>BASIC</auth-method>
    <realm-name>Monitoring</realm-name>
</login-config>

<security-role>
    <role-name>Admin</role-name>
</security-role>
```
By setting the above configuration, only authenticated users with the 'Admin' role will be able to access the '/monitoring' URL.

### Step 2: Encrypt Your Monitoring Data 

JavaMelody provides an option to encrypt your monitoring data. You can set the parameter ‘javamelody.obfuscation-password’ in your spring boot application properties. 

```properties
javamelody.obfuscation-password=yoursecurepassword
```
