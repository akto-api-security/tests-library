# Remediation for BOLA_ADD_CUSTOM_HEADER_INTEGER_ID_PATCH

## Remediation Steps for Exploiting BOLA by Adding Custom Header with Integer IDs for Unauthorized Access for PATCH/PUT method APIs

Exploiting the Binding of Local Addresses (BOLA) by adding custom headers with integer IDs for unauthorized access using PATCH or PUT method APIs is a significant security issue. Attackers could potentially manipulate data or gain unauthorized access using this vulnerability.

### Step 1: Validate User Input
Firstly, always sanitize and validate user inputs. An API operation should never directly use the identifiers passed by a client.

Here is a Python example:

```python
def validate_user_input(user_input):
    # check if the input indeed is of integer type
    if not isinstance(user_input, int):
        raise TypeError('Expected an Integer')
    # perform additional checks to validate the integer ID here
```

### Step 2: Implement Authorization Mechanisms
Authorization mechanisms should be properly implemented to prevent unauthorized access. Users should only be able to modify data they are authorized for.

```python
def check_user_has_access(user, resource_id):
    resource_owner = get_resource_owner(resource_id)
    if user != resource_owner:
        raise UnauthorizedAccessException('Operator is not allowed')
```

### Step 3: Upgrade to the Latest Dependencies
Always make sure your server dependencies are up-to-date. This will ensure you have the latest patches and security updates.

```bash
pip install --upgrade package-name
```

### Step 4: Use Prepared Statements for SQL queries
If the API is interacting with a database, always use prepared statements for SQL queries to prevent SQL Injection.

```python
import psycopg2

try:
    connection = psycopg2.connect(user="username",
                                  password="password",
                                  host="127.0.0.1",
                                  port="5432",
                                  database="database_name")

    cursor = connection.cursor()
    
    postgreSQL_select_Query = "SELECT * FROM mobile WHERE ID = %s"
    cursor.execute(postgreSQL_select_Query, (user_input, ))

except (Exception, psycopg2.Error) as error:
    print("Error fetching data from PostgreSQL table", error)
```

### Step 5: Regular Audit
Make sure to perform regular security audits and code reviews to catch and fix any security vulnerabilities.
