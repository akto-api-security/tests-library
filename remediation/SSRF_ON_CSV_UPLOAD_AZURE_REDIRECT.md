# Remediation for SSRF_ON_CSV_UPLOAD_AZURE_REDIRECT

## Remediation Steps for Exposed Sensitive Azure Details

The exposure of sensitive Azure details through SSRF is a serious security concern. In order to seal the security vulnerability, you need to implement measures that secure and limit outside access to your Azure parameters.

### Step 1: Limit SSRF Vulnerability

To limit accesses to the internal network from the application, you need to employ the following measures:

```java
// Using Java's URLConnection Class

try {
  URL url = new URL(userInput);
  url.openConnection();
  // invoke method like getInputStream() or getResponse() after
} catch (Exception e) {
  // handle exception
}
```

### Step 2: Safe Data Redirection

Implement safe redirect logic by using only server-side known, valid URLs for redirection. Do not let user-supplied data define redirect locations directly.

```java
// Using Java

String safeRedirectLocation = "/secured/location";
response.sendRedirect(response.encodeRedirectURL(safeRedirectLocation));
```

### Step 3: Implement Input Validation 

Input validation should be applied on both syntactical and semantic level.

Syntactical validation should enforce correct syntax of structured fields 

Semantic validation should enforce correctness of their values in the specific business context.

```python
# Using Python with wtforms library
from wtforms import Form, TextField, validators

class RegistrationForm(Form):
    username = TextField('Username', [validators.Length(min=4, max=25)])
    email = TextField('Email Address', [validators.Length(min=6, max=35)])
```

### Step 4: Access Control and Least Privilege 

Ensure that the application enforces access controls and session management on all URLs and does not incorrectly expose any sensitive functionality or data via URLs. 

```C#
// Using C# with ASP.NET Core
[Authorize]
public class HomeController : Controller
{
    public ActionResult Index()
    {
        return View();
    }
}
```
