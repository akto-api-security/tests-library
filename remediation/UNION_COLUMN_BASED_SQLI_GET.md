# Remediation for UNION_COLUMN_BASED_SQLI_GET

## Remediation Steps for Union Based SQL Injection Test with Column Variations on GET Method APIs
Union Based SQL Injection is a common vulnerability where an attacker can inject SQL commands in user input areas, potentially gaining unauthorized access to your database. Here are some remediation steps you can follow to prevent this vulnerability.

### Step 1: Use Parameterized Queries
One of the most effective ways to protect a web site from SQL injection is to use parameterized queries. This code ensures that an attacker is not able to change the intent of a query.
```java
String selectSQL = "SELECT USER_ID FROM USERS WHERE USERNAME = ?";
PreparedStatement preparedStatement = dbConnection.prepareStatement(selectSQL);
preparedStatement.setString(1, "user1");
ResultSet rs = preparedStatement.executeQuery(selectSQL );
while (rs.next()) {
    String userid = rs.getString("USER_ID");
    System.out.println("userid : " + userid);
}
```

### Step 2: Use ORM (Object Relational Mapping)
Object-relational mapping (ORM) libraries like Hibernate or Entity Framework automatically escape inputs as needed and are resistant to SQL Injection.

### Step 3: Regularly Update and Patch
Keep your system, server, and applications updated with the latest patches. Security patches will often fix vulnerabilities that can be exploited by SQL injections.

### Step 4: Use of Web Application Firewalls 
Web application firewalls (WAFs) can help to detect and block SQL Injections attacks, they provide a additional layer of security.
```bash
sudo apt-get install mod-security # for Ubuntu
```

### Step 5: Store Database Credentials Securely
Do not store database connection strings or credentials in your code. Use environment variables or other secure methods to store this information.
