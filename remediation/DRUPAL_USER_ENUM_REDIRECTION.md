# Remediation for DRUPAL_USER_ENUM_REDIRECTION

## Remediation Steps for Drupal User Enumeration with Redirection

Drupal User Enumeration with Redirection can put user data at risk if not properly detected and prevented. Follow these steps to mitigate this vulnerability.

### Step 1: Update to the Latest Drupal Version

Drupal core often releases updates and patches to fix any known vulnerabilities. Therefore, ensure your Drupal core is updated to the latest version.

```bash
drush up drupal
```

### Step 2: Install and Configure User Enum Prevention Module

The Drupal community provides a module that prevents user enumeration. Install and enable this module.

```bash
drush en user_enum_prevent -y
```

### Step 3: Update Your Site's Configuration to Disable User Enumeration

You can configure your site to prevent user enumeration in the "Account settings" (found at '/admin/config/people/accounts').

Under "REGISTRATION AND CANCELLATION", ensure that "Visitors, but administrator approval is required" or "Administrators only" is selected.

Additionally, under "Administrator approval required", ensure that "Require e-mail verification when a visitor creates an account" is checked.

### Step 4: Regular Audit and Update

Constantly check for updates to the core and installed modules, and apply them as soon as possible.

```bash
drush up
```

Remember, regular updates and audits of your Drupal site play a significant role in preventing and mitigating vulnerabilities.
