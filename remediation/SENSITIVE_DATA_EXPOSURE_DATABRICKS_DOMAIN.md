# Remediation for SENSITIVE_DATA_EXPOSURE_DATABRICKS_DOMAIN

## Remediation Steps for Sensitive Data Exposure on Databricks Domain

Sensitive data exposure is a critical security issue that may allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data within the Databricks domain. This could lead to severe consequences such as data leakage, integrity compromise, and unauthorized actions on the data.

### Step 1: Secure Transport with HTTPS
For web traffic, ensure to always use HTTPS over HTTP to encrypt communication and help protect against man-in-the-middle attacks.

```bash
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [L,R=301]
```
Place this code in .htaccess file to enforce HTTPS connection.

### Step 2: Enable Secure Cookie
The Databricks domain should use secure cookies to prevent exposure of session IDs over unencrypted connections. 

Please note that the approach may vary based on your programming language. Here's an example in Python with Flask:

```python
from flask import Flask, session

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE'] = True
```
### Step 3: Role-Based Access Control
Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to restrict access to sensitive data based on user roles. Make sure to enforce minimum privilege principle, i.e., grant only the access level that a user needs to perform their task.

```python
# Python pseudo code for RBAC
class User:
    def __init__(self, roles: list):
        self.roles = roles

    def has_access(self, resource):
        for role in self.roles:
            if resource in role.permissions:
                return True
        return False
```
### Step 4: Implement Data Masking
Mask sensitive data to protect it when it is displayed. Here is an example of data masking in Python.

```python
def mask_sensitive_data(sensitive_data):
    return '*' * len(sensitive_data)

masked_data = mask_sensitive_data('Sensitive data')
print(masked_data)  # Output: **************
```
### Step 5: Regular Audit and Update
Regularly update and audit your systems for any possible leaks or breaches. Always keep your system and its security measures up to date.
