## Remediation Steps for Prompt Injection Test on LLMs for XSS

Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side script, to a different end user. Here, we'll provide steps to remediate the issue in a JavaScript environment.

### Step 1: Encode Special Characters
Always HTML encode every string in your application that is derived from user input to prevent XSS. 

```javascript
function encodeHTML(html){
    var div = document.createElement('div');
    var text = document.createTextNode(html);
    div.appendChild(text);
    return div.innerHTML;
}
```
Use the above function to encode HTML inputs.

### Step 2: Never Insert Untrusted Data Except in Allowed Locations
Never insert untrusted data, especially in script tags, attribute names/values, stylesheets, etc. 

### Step 3: Use Content Security Policy (CSP)
Itâ€™s an additional layer of security that helps to detect and mitigate certain types of XSS attacks. 

```bash
Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'self' https://apis.google.com
```
This would allow scripts to be downloaded from your domain and `apis.google.com`.
