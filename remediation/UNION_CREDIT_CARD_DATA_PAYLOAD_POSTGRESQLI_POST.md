# Remediation for UNION_CREDIT_CARD_DATA_PAYLOAD_POSTGRESQLI_POST

## Remediation Steps for Union based SQL Injection

Union based SQL Injection is a serious security vulnerability that could lead to unauthorized data access, including credit card details. Below are steps to prevent this issue.

### Step 1: Parameterize SQL Queries
Always use parameterized SQL queries to prevent any form of SQL Injection. This can be done via SQL parameterized queries or stored procedures for most languages. Here is an example in Python using `psycopg2`.

```python
import psycopg2

# Establish a database connection
conn = psycopg2.connect(
    dbname="yourdbname",
    user="yourusername",
    password="yourpassword",
    host="localhost"
)

cur = conn.cursor()

# Parameterized query to protect against SQL Injection
user_id = '123'
cur.execute('SELECT * FROM Users WHERE UserId = %s', (user_id,))

# Fetch and print the result
rows = cur.fetchall()
for row in rows:
    print(row)
```

### Step 2: Input Validation and Sanitization
Use Web Application Firewall and rigorously validate all input data server-side. Types, length, format, and number ranges should all be validated.

```python
def sanitize_input(input_data):
    # Remove problematic characters
    sanitized_data = re.sub('[-;\'"/*]', '', input_data)

    return sanitized_data
``` 

### Step 3: Least Privilege Principle
The application's database user should not have more privileges than necessary. Specifically, the user should not have `UNION` capabilities if unnecessary. To do this in PostgreSQL, you could:

```bash
REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES ON your_table FROM your_user;
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON your_table TO your_user;
```

### Step 4: Regular Audit and Update 
Always keep your systems updated and do not ignore the latest security fixes and patches.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
```

### Step 5: Protect Sensitive Data
Always encrypt sensitive data like credit card information.

```python
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
import base64

SECRET_KEY = 'your-secret-key'

def encrypt_val(clear_text):
    cipher = AES.new(SECRET_KEY[:32])
    enc_val = base64.b64encode(cipher.encrypt(clear_text.rjust(32)))
    return enc_val
```

Also, consider not storing sensitive data at all, if not required.

Remember, there is no substitute to understanding the security aspects. Always seek expert advice, conduct regular vulnerability assessments, security audits, and code reviews to identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities.
