# Remediation for SENSITIVE_DATA_EXPOSURE_DATA_FILE

## Remediation Steps for Sensitive Data Exposure for DATA FILE
Sensitive data exposure is a critical security issue. Without proper encryption and access controls, attackers might gain unauthorized access to sensitive information.

### Step 1: Encrypt the Sensitive Data File
Depending on the context, you can use different methods to encrypt your file. For instance, you can use Gnu Privacy Guard (GnuPG) to encrypt your files.

```bash
gpg -c DATA_FILE
```

This will prompt you for a passphrase. Remember this passphrase as you'll need it to decrypt the file.

### Step 2: Set Strong File Permissions
Add additional layers of protection by setting strong file permissions. You can restrict access to the file using `chmod` command.

```bash
chmod 700 DATA_FILE.gpg
```

With this, only the owner of the file can read, write, and execute the file.

### Step 3: Secure File Storage
Consider storing your encrypted file in a secure location. If it is to be stored on a cloud storage, make sure that the storage account is secure and access is restricted.

### Step 4: Regular Audit and Updates
Regularly review and update your encryption and access control mechanisms. If possible, automate the encryption and decryption process through scripts or tools.

```bash
# To decrypt the file when needed
gpg DATA_FILE.gpg
``` 

This will prompt you for the passphrase. After providing the correct passphrase, you will get access to the original data file. Implement a policy for secure passphrase storage and renewal.

Please remember: encryption should not be the only control. It is merely one part of a holistic security strategy. Other security controls such as secure coding practices, secure network design, intrusion detection systems, etc., should also be implemented to protect sensitive data.
