## Remediation Steps for Sensitive Data Exposure for DATA FILE
Sensitive data exposure is a critical security issue. Without proper encryption and access controls, attackers might gain unauthorized access to sensitive information.

### Step 1: Encrypt the Sensitive Data File
Depending on the context, you can use different methods to encrypt your file. For instance, you can use Gnu Privacy Guard (GnuPG) to encrypt your files.

```bash
gpg -c DATA_FILE
```

This will prompt you for a passphrase. Remember this passphrase as you'll need it to decrypt the file.

### Step 2: Set Strong File Permissions
Add additional layers of protection by setting strong file permissions. You can restrict access to the file using `chmod` command.

```bash
chmod 700 DATA_FILE.gpg
```

With this, only the owner of the file can read, write, and execute the file.

### Step 3: Secure File Storage
Consider storing your encrypted file in a secure location. If it is to be stored on a cloud storage, make sure that the storage account is secure and access is restricted.
