# Remediation for PAGINATION_MISCONFIGURATION

## Remediation Steps for Possible DOS Attack by Pagination Misconfiguration

Pagination misconfiguration may result in a Distributed Denial of Service (DOS) attack, overloading the server due to the loading of an excessive number of objects. 

### Step 1: Define Maximum Limit
To mitigate this security issue, you should always define a maximum limit to the number of items that can be loaded at a given time. A properly configured limit ensures reasonable performance while maintaining utility for the end user.

```python
MAX_LIMIT = 100

def paginate(request, default_limit=50):
    try:
        limit = min(int(request.GET.get('limit', default_limit)), MAX_LIMIT)
    except ValueError:
        limit = default_limit
    return limit
```

### Step 2: Use Cursor-Based Pagination
Cursor-based pagination, rather than offset-based pagination, is also an effective way to protect against pagination-based DOS attacks.

```python
from rest_framework.pagination import CursorPagination

class MyModelCursorPagination(CursorPagination):
    page_size = 50
    ordering = 'id'
```

### Step 3: Rate Limiting
Implementing rate limiting on the server can provide an extra layer of security, reducing the risk of successful DOS attacks.

```python
from django_ratelimit.decorators import ratelimit

@ratelimit(key='ip', rate='10/m')  # limiting 10 requests per minute
def my_view(request):
    # Your implementation here
```
