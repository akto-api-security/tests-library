# Remediation for BYPASS_PRODUCT_RETURN_VALIDATION

## Remediation Steps for Bypass Product Return Validation
Bypassing product return validation presents a significant security risk. Attackers could exploit the flaw to bypass return policies, resulting in potential loss of goods and undue refunds.

### Step 1: Validate Product Return on Server Side
Never trust the client side validations fully, always have server side validations as well. In Java, for example:

```java
if(product.isReturnable()){
    processReturn(product);
} else {
    throw new Exception("Product return not allowed");
}
```
It is best practice to validate return at server side because client side data can be tampered.

### Step 2: Authenticate and Authorise
Check if the user is authenticated and authorised to return the product. It can be implemented, in JavaScript for example, as follows:

```javascript
if (user.authenticated && user.role === 'ROLE_USER') {
    processReturn(product);
} else {
    throw new Error("User is not authorized to return the product");
}
```
### Step 3: Check Physical Product Return
Before providing any refund, make sure the physical product has been returned and is in expected condition. This mostly requires offline checking.

### Step 4: Use Secure and Standard Libraries
Use tested and standard libraries for validation, parsing and decoding where ever you need to handle user supplied inputs. 

### Step 5: Apply Appropriate Sanitizers
Apply appropriate sanitizer on required fields to guard against any encoding/decoding attack. 

### Step 6: Regular Audit and Update
Regularly audit the return process. Check logs and look for any suspicious activity. Make sure you apply updates as soon as they become available. 

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
```
  
Remember, security should be built in, not bolted on. Creating secure applications should be a priority, not an afterthought.
