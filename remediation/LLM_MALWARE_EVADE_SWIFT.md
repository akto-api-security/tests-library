## Remediation Steps for Overreliance on LLMs - Evading Anti-Malware with Swift

Overreliance on Language Library Modules (LLMs) can render security tools ineffective and lead to the possibility of malware threats and attacks. In this case, a Swift program could evade Anti-malware software if it relies too much on LLMs.
    
### Step 1: Scan and Monitor Swift Code 
Deploy security tools and scanners that are designed to detect vulnerabilities in Swift code. Run these tools regularly to find any possible areas of improvement in your Swift code.

### Step 2: Minimize Overreliance on LLMs
Try to create own functions and avoid overusing LLMs which can help in hiding function definition. This can help to reduce the risk attached to the overreliance on such modules. 

```swift
// Instead of relying too much on built-in Libraries, create own functions
func minVal(x: Int, y: Int){
  if x < y {
    return x
  } else {
    return y
  }
}
```


### Step 3: Implement Security Best Practices
Follow Swift's security best practices, regularly review your code base for any anomalies or strange behaviors.
