# Remediation for UNION_BASED_SQLI_XSS_POST

## Remediation Steps for Union Based SQL Injection Test with XSS for POST Method APIs

A union-based SQL injection and XSS via POST Method APIs can occur due to inappropriate validation and sanitizing of user input. This issue can lead to unauthorized access and data leaks. This can be remediated by adequate sanitizing and validating of user input data and using parameterized queries.

### Step 1: Sanitize and Validate Input Data

Sanitize and validate all user inputs. This will prevent malicious scripts and SQL queries from being executed. 

In a Python environment, you can use a library like bleach.

```python
import bleach

def sanitize(user_input):
    return bleach.clean(user_input)
```
### Step 2: Use Parameterized Queries

To prevent SQL injection, it's recommended to use parameterized queries, using placeholders for user inputs in the SQL statement to ensure the input is treated as literal text and not part of the SQL command.

If you're using Python with a MySQL database, you can do something like:

```python
import mysql.connector

cnx = mysql.connector.connect(user='<username>', password='<password>', host='127.0.0.1', database='<database>')
cursor = cnx.cursor()

query = ("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username=%s AND password=%s")
cursor.execute(query, (username, password,))
```
### Step 3: Use HTTP-Only Cookies

Use HTTP-Only Cookies to prevent XSS attacks. This can be done in Python Flask as follows:

```python
from flask import make_response

@app.route('/')
def index():
    resp = make_response(render_template(...))
    resp.set_cookie('username', 'flask', httponly=True, secure=True)
    return resp
```
### Step 4: Content Security Policy

Implement Content Security Policy headers to restrict the execution of scripts or the loading of resources. With Flask in Python, you can use Flask-Talisman.

```python
from flask_talisman import Talisman

app = Flask(__name__)
Talisman(app)
```
