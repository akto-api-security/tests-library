## Remediation Steps for Sensitive Data Exposure for RABBITMQ URI

Sensitive data exposure for RabbitMQ URI can pose a serious threat. When sensitive data such as connection strings or credentials are leaked, a malicious actor can potentially gain unauthorized access to the messaging system.

### Step 1: Secure the RABBITMQ URI

The RABBITMQ URI should not be hardcoded in the source code, as this could lead to exposure. Instead, consider storing the URI in an environment variable. 

```python
import os

rabbitmq_uri = os.getenv('RABBITMQ_URI')
```

For shell scripts,

```bash
RABBITMQ_URI=your_uri
export RABBITMQ_URI
```

### Step 2: Encrypt the RABBITMQ URI

If it's feasible for your application, consider encrypting the RabbitMQ URI before storing and decrypting it when needed.

```python
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet

def encrypt(message: str, key: str) -> str:
    """
    Encrypts a message
    """
    return Fernet(key).encrypt(message.encode())

def decrypt(token: str, key: str) -> str:
    """
    Decrypts an encrypted message
    """
    return Fernet(key).decrypt(token.encode())

# You can then encrypt the URI before storing and decrypt when needed.
encrypted_rabbitmq_uri = encrypt(rabbitmq_uri, your_key)
```
