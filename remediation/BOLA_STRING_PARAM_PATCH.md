## Remediation Steps for Exploiting BOLA: Direct System Operation Using String Parameter Values with PATCH/PUT Based APIs

Exploiting BOLA (Broken Object Level Authorization) can result in unauthorized access to sensitive data. In this type of attack, an attacker manipulates identifiers that are used to access objects directly, such as replacing the 'ID' value in a URL or JSON body with an ID of another object.

### Step 1: Authorize Actions and API Endpoints
Only allow authorized actions to relevant API endpoints. Strong access controls should be implemented by validating the user's actions using a designated authorization framework such as OWASP's ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy).

```python
from flask import request
from werkzeug.exceptions import Forbidden

def authorization_check(permission):
    if not current_user.can(permission):
        raise Forbidden()
```

### Step 2: Validate Input

Authenticate and validate all API input, this prevents an attacker from manipulating strings or identifiers. This can be accomplished by verifying the legitimacy of the input's origin and by using parameterized statements.

```python
def validate_input(input):
    if not isinstance(input, str) or len(input) > MAX_INPUT_LENGTH:
        raise ValueError("Invalid input.")
```
