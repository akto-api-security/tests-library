# Remediation for ELASTICSEARCH_INFO_DISCLOSURE

## Remediation Steps for Elasticsearch Information Disclosure

Elasticsearch Information Disclosure is a significant security vulnerability where sensitive data can be accessed by an unauthorized user utilizing Elasticsearch services. To remediate, you need to enable strict index permissions, ensure any sensitive data is well encrypted and secure the Elasticsearch server.

### Step 1: Enable Strict Index Permissions
Firstly, ensure that only the necessary users have access to the document indices by controlling permissions in Elasticsearch. 

```bash
PUT /my_index/_settings
{
  "index" : {
    "blocks.read_only_allow_delete" : true
  }
}
```

This command will lock the 'my_index', only allowing delete operations when disk usage reaches the flood stage watermark. `blocks.read_only_allow_delete` should be set to `false` when you want to unlock writing or metadata changes again.

### Step 2: Encrypt Sensitive Data
Ensure that sensitive data is encrypted and not plain text. Using a tool like Elasticsearch's X-Pack Security can encrypt internode communication and can be set up using the following.

```bash
bin/elasticsearch-certutil cert
bin/elasticsearch-certutil http
```

### Step 3: Secure Elasticsearch Server

It's important to secure the Elasticsearch server by enabling user authorization and disabling anonymous access.

```bash
PUT _cluster/settings
{
  "persistent": {
    "xpack.security.authc.accept_default_password": "false"
  }
}
PUT /_security/role_mapping/THIS_IS_JUST_AN_EXAMPLE
{ 
  "enabled": false
}
```
