## Remediation Steps for Sensitive Localhost Details Exposure via SSRF

Exposing sensitive localhost details via replacing URI param to encoded localhost/admin due to Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerabilities is a serious issue. Without properly securing these details, attackers may gain unauthorized access to the system, effectively compromising its security.

### Step 1: Validate or Sanitize User Inputs
You must ensure that user inputs are strictly validated or sanitized. Only accept input that meets a very specific definition of what's considered a valid format.

```python
import re

def sanitize_url(user_input):
    # Whitelist acceptable URI syntax (As per your requirements)
    pattern = "^https?://[a-zA-Z0-9-_.]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,4}"
    if not re.match(pattern, user_input):
        raise ValueError("Invalid URL format.")
    return user_input
```

### Step 2: Limit or Disable URLs to localhost, 127.0.0.1 or 0.0.0.0
Here, block every request that tries to access a resource from localhost or any of its other representations like `127.0.0.1` or `0.0.0.0`.

```python
def block_localhost(user_input):
    localhost_patterns = ["localhost", "127.0.0.1", "0.0.0.0"]
    for pattern in localhost_patterns:
        if pattern in user_input:
            raise ValueError(f"Blocked a {pattern} access attempt.")
    return user_input
```
