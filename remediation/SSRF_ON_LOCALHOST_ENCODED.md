# Remediation for SSRF_ON_LOCALHOST_ENCODED

## Remediation Steps for Sensitive Localhost Details Exposure via SSRF

Exposing sensitive localhost details via replacing URI param to encoded localhost/admin due to Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerabilities is a serious issue. Without properly securing these details, attackers may gain unauthorized access to the system, effectively compromising its security.

### Step 1: Validate or Sanitize User Inputs
You must ensure that user inputs are strictly validated or sanitized. Only accept input that meets a very specific definition of what's considered a valid format.

```python
import re

def sanitize_url(user_input):
    # Whitelist acceptable URI syntax (As per your requirements)
    pattern = "^https?://[a-zA-Z0-9-_.]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,4}"
    if not re.match(pattern, user_input):
        raise ValueError("Invalid URL format.")
    return user_input
```

### Step 2: Limit or Disable URLs to localhost, 127.0.0.1 or 0.0.0.0
Here, block every request that tries to access a resource from localhost or any of its other representations like `127.0.0.1` or `0.0.0.0`.

```python
def block_localhost(user_input):
    localhost_patterns = ["localhost", "127.0.0.1", "0.0.0.0"]
    for pattern in localhost_patterns:
        if pattern in user_input:
            raise ValueError(f"Blocked a {pattern} access attempt.")
    return user_input
```

### Step 3: Use a Reputable Security Library
There are a number of reputable security libraries available that already deal with these common vulnerabilities. OWASP's [ESAPI](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Enterprise_Security_API) is one such library.

### Step 4: Regular Audit and Update
Regular audits and updates to your system are crucial for maintaining its security. Upgrade to the latest versions of libraries and tools, and keep yourself updated about new vulnerabilities or security procedures.

Remember, no amount of sanitization or input validation will help if your systems or the software they're running is outdated. 

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
```
