# Remediation for REFERRER_EXPOSES_SESSION_ID

## Remediation Steps for Referer Exposes Session ID
Exposing the session ID in the referer header is a significant security risk as it may lead to session hijacking. Promptly addressing this issue is essential to protecting the user's session and maintaining secure communication. 
### Step 1: Avoid Passing Session ID in URL

Passing the Session ID in URL can be harmful as it will be stored in many places automatically. Prefer to use cookies to store session IDs. 

Here is an example in PHP:

```php
ini_set('session.use_cookies', 1);
ini_set('session.use_only_cookies', 1);
ini_set('session.use_trans_sid', 0);
session_start();
```

### Step 2: Apply 'rel=noreferrer' 

By setting `rel=noreferrer` in the anchor tag, it'll prevent the browser from sending the referer header. 

```html
<a href="http://example.com" rel="noreferrer">Example Link</a>
```

### Step 3: Use Meta Tag to Control Referer Policy
The meta tag can be used to control the referer policy site wide. By setting the referer policy to `no-referrer`, the browser will not send the referer header.

```html
<head>
<meta name="referrer" content="no-referrer">
</head>
```

### Step 4: Implement a CSRF Token
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack that tricks the victim into submitting a malicious request. By implementing a CSRF token, you can prevent session IDs from being exposed.

Here's a simple example in Ruby on Rails:

```ruby
protect_from_forgery with: :exception
```

### Step 5: Regular Security Audit 
Make sure to perform regular security audits in your application to identify and rectify potential security issues. This includes keeping a close eye on session management guidelines and following them.
