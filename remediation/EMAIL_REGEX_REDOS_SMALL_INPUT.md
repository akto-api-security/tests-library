## Remediation Steps for ReDOS Test on Email Parameters with Small Input

Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDOS) exploits badly written regular expressions that have exponential worst-case complexity. However, well-written regex can prevent this vulnerability.

Removing the vulnerability requires enhancing the regular expression pattern that you use to test email parameters to ensure it runs in linear time complexity, thereby eliminating the ReDOS threat.

Here is how to do it in JavaScript:

### Step 1: Regular Expression Logic Improvement
Replace the current regular expression logic with the following:
```javascript
const emailRegex = /^[\w-]+(\.[\w-]+)*@([a-z0-9-]+(\.[a-z0-9]+)*?\.[a-z]{2,6}|(\d{1,3}\.){3}\d{1,3})(:\d{4})?$/i;
```
This regex pattern works in linear time, thus eliminating the probability of ReDOS.

### Step 2: Validate Your Email Parameter
Use the regular expression to validate your email parameters as follows:
```javascript
function validateEmail(email) {
    return emailRegex.test(email);
}
```
Once you have made these changes and tested the new function, the ReDOS vulnerability on your email parameters should be fixed. Make sure to always monitor your applications for potential threats. Regular audits and updates are crucial when addressing security concerns.
