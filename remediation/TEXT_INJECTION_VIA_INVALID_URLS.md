# Remediation for TEXT_INJECTION_VIA_INVALID_URLS

## Remediation Steps for Text Injection via Invalid URLs

Text injection through invalid URLs is a serious vulnerability that can result in cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks or phishing incidents. To secure your application, consider the following measures:

### Step 1: Input Validation
Depend on server-side input validation to determine if URLs are in the correct format. Use pattern matching or regex to validate the input. By limiting the allowed characters in a URL, you can prevent attackers from injecting malicious text into the app.

For instance, in JavaScript, you can use an express middleware as a validation layer:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.use((req, res, next) => {
    const urlRegex = /^(https?:\/\/)?([\w.]+)\.([a-z]{2,}?)(.?)(\/[\w.]*)*\/?$/;
    if (urlRegex.test(req.url)) {
        next();
    } else {
        res.status(400).send({error: 'Invalid URL.'});
    }
});
```

### Step 2: Sanitize User Input

Removing or replacing any possibly malicious user inputs can also protect you from text injection attacks. In PHP, you can accomplish this with the `filter_var` function.

```php
<?php
$url = $_POST['url'];
$sanitized_url = filter_var($url, FILTER_SANITIZE_URL);

if (filter_var($sanitized_url, FILTER_VALIDATE_URL)) {
    echo "This URL is valid.";
} else {
    echo "This URL is invalid.";
}
?>
```

### Step 3: Use Safe and Reliable Libraries

Libraries such as OWASP Java Encoder for Java or Django's urlize for Python can encode URLs and prevent malicious inputs from jeopardizing your application.

Below is an example using Django:

```python
from django.utils.html import urlize

text = '<email@example.com>' # insert user's input safely
safe_text = urlize(text)
```

### Step 4: Use Content Security Policy (CSP)
Implement a Content Security Policy in your web application to control the sources from which content is being loaded onto your webpage. This will assist in preventing text injection attacks.

```bash
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'none'; script-src 'self'; connect-src 'self'; img-src 'self'; style-src 'self';
```
