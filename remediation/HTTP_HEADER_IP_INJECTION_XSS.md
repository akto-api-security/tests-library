# Remediation for HTTP_HEADER_IP_INJECTION_XSS

## Remediation Steps for XSS in HTTP Headers Containing IP Address
Cross Site Scripting (XSS) in HTTP headers is a serious security issue. Exploiting this vulnerability, attackers can execute malicious scripts in the victim's web browser, thereby gaining access to sensitive information and potentially gaining unauthorized control over their interactions with the web application.

### Step 1: Sanitize Input
Ensure that all user input is sanitized before it's used. This reduces the chance of nefarious code being executed. In JavaScript, this can be executed by encoding HTML entities with the following code:
```javascript
function sanitizeInput(string) {
    var map = {
        '&': '&amp;',
        '<': '&lt;',
        '>': '&gt;',
        '"': '&quot;',
        "'": '&#039;'
    };
    return string.replace(/[&<>"']/g, function(m) { return map[m]; });
}
```
### Step 2: Content Security Policy
Adding a Content Security Policy (CSP) HTTP header to your web application can help to significantly reduce the risk of XSS attacks by declaring which dynamic resources are allowed to load.

```http
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'
```
### Step 3: HTTPOnly and Secure Cookie Flags
Ensure that cookies are set with the “SECURE” and “HTTPOnly” flags. The HTTPOnly flag prevents an attacker from accessing the cookie through client-side scripts, reducing the risk of XSS attacks.

```python
response.set_cookie('name', 'value', secure=True, httponly=True)
```
