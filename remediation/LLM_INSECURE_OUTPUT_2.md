# Remediation for LLM_INSECURE_OUTPUT_2

## Remediation Steps for Insecure Output Handling: Display Email Vulnerable String in LLMs
LLMs (Language Learning Management Systems) may sometimes have insecure output handling which can potentially lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. In this case, the insecure handling of displaying email strings needs to be addressed.

Insecure output handling can lead to information exposure, input validation issues and XSS attacks among others. Remediation primarily involves properly sanitizing and validating all user inputs and protecting against XSS.

### Step 1: Properly sanitize and validate user inputs
```python
import re
def sanitize_email(email):
  # Regex for validating an Email
  reg = "^(\w|\.|\_|\-)+[@](\w|\_|\-|\.)+[.]\w{2,3}$"

  # If the string is an Email, return True
  if(re.search(reg, email)):
    return True

  else:
    return False
```
### Step 2: Protect against Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
```javascript
// Assuming express.js is being used
var express = require('express');
var app = express();

var xssFilters = require('xss-filters');
app.use(function(req, res, next) {
  if(req.body){
    for (let i in req.body){
      if(req.body[i]){
        req.body[i] = xssFilters.inHTMLData(req.body[i]);  
      }
    }
  }
  next();
});
```
### Step 3: Test for success
After the steps above are implemented, it's imperative to test if they work as expected. This includes asserting correct inputs get through the validation and sanitization logic, while incorrect inputs do not.

If the steps above did not resolve the issue, please dig deeper into your specific LLMs setup. It could be that other specific configurations or issues are causing insecure output handling.
