# Remediation for COMMAND_INJECTION_TIME_DELAY

## Remediation Steps for Command Injection Using Time Delay Sleep Command
Command injection is a form of security vulnerability in an application where an attacker can execute arbitrary OS commands. 

### Step 1: Whenever Possible, Avoid System Calls
The best way to prevent command injection is to not use system calls if at all possible. However, if you must use system calls, be sure to sanitize any user-provided input that will be included in the system command.

However, if the use of system calls is inevitable, the following steps should be considered:

### Step 2: Use Safe APIs
If available, use safe APIs such as parameterized processes or libraries, as they are not susceptible to command injection. Here is an example using Java:

```java
ProcessBuilder processBuilder = new ProcessBuilder("your command", "your arg");
Process process = processBuilder.start();
```

### Step 3: Escaping Special Characters
If a safe API is not available, escape/encode all user-supplied input to your system call. This would look similar to the following:

```python
import shlex
# Shlex's quote function can be used to safely escape user-provided input
command = shlex.quote(user_input)
```

### Step 4: Least Privilege
Run your application with the least privilege necessary, and restrict the commands the application is allowed to run if possible. 

### Step 5: Input Validation
Always validate user input to ensure it fits within expected parameters. This could be as simple as checking if a number entered is actually a number, to using something like a regular expression to check if a string matches certain patterns.

### Step 6: Regular Update and Step up Monitoring
Regularly update and patch all systems to ensure security vulnerabilities are fixed. This is crucial in avoiding exploitation. It's also necessary to invest in intrusion detection systems and/or set up logging to monitor for suspicious activity on your application.
