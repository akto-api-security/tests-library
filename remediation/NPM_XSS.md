## Remediation Steps for Cross-Site Scripting in npm Packages

Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a serious security vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. To fix XSS vulnerabilities in npm packages, you can follow the steps below:

### Step 1: Validate and Sanitize Input
One of the common reasons XSS vulnerabilities arise is due to unvalidated or unsanitized user inputs. Apply input validation and sanitization using npm libraries like 'validator' or 'xss'.
```javascript
const validator = require('validator');

let userInput = "<script>malicious code</script>";
userInput = validator.escape(userInput);
```
```bash
npm install xss
```
```javascript
let xss = require('xss');
let userInput = "<script>malicious code</script>";
userInput = xss(userInput);
```

### Step 2: Use Content-Security-Policy
Add a Content-Security-Policy HTTP response header in your application to limit the types of content the browser is allowed to load.
```javascript
const helmet = require('helmet');

app.use(helmet.contentSecurityPolicy({
  directives: {
    defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
    scriptSrc: ["'self'"],
    styleSrc: ["'self'"],
  }
}));
```
