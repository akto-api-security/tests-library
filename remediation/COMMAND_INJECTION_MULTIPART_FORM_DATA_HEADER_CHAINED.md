# Remediation for COMMAND_INJECTION_MULTIPART_FORM_DATA_HEADER_CHAINED

## Remediation Steps for Command Injection in Content-Type Headers

This issue is caused by a security vulnerability where Command Injection can occur within Content-Type headers having Multipart form data value.

### Step 1: Validate incoming data

Ensure only expected content types are allowed. If the content type isn't on your whitelist, reject the request entirely. This can be accomplished by using middleware functions that validate content types before they reach your main application logic. 

```python
from flask import Flask, request, abort

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.before_request
def limit_content_type():
    if request.headers.get('Content-Type') not in ['application/json', 'multipart/form-data']:
        abort(415)  # Unsupported Media Type
```
For this example, we're only accepting `application/json` and `multipart/form-data` content types.

### Step 2: Input sanitization

Implement strong server-side input validation and sanitization to ensure only valid, expected system instructions are passed, disallowing any special characters that could allow for command injection.

```python
import re

def sanitize_input(input_string):
    # This regex pattern eliminates special characters used in system commands
    pattern = re.compile('[$&;|]')
    sanitized_input = re.sub(pattern, '', input_string)
    return sanitized_input
```
Call `sanitize_input(input_string)` method before processing your input.

### Step 3: Use Safe APIs

Avoid APIs and functions that allow or perform system commands directly. If it is unavoidable, make sure to implement strong validation and sanitization measures before passing any inputs to these APIs or functions. 

```python
# Avoid this
os.system(user_input)
# Use this instead
subprocess.run(['ls', '-l'])
```

### Step 4: Regular Audit and Update

Make sure to keep your system up-to-date and perform regular security audits to identify and fix any existing vulnerabilities. 

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y
```
This shall provide upgraded security patches for the system.

Note: Sample examples are given in Python and bash scripts. You may have to change the code block according to your language stack.
