## Remediation Steps for Password Reset Endpoint Poisoning via Middleware

Password reset endpoint poisoning via middleware can be a severe security issue. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access and control over accounts. To fix this, we need to ensure that the password reset endpoint is secure.

### Step 1: Secure Password Reset Endpoint 
First, let's secure the password reset endpoint. We should validate the email or username before sending the password reset link to prevent potential exploitation. 

If we are using Node.js with Express.js, you could do something like this:

```javascript
app.post('/reset_password', function(req, res) {
    const email = req.body.email;
    if ( validateEmail(email) ) { // implement validateEmail to check if the email is valid
        // your code to initiate password resetting
    } else {
        res.status(400).send('Invalid email');
    }
});
```
### Step 2: Implement Rate Limiting
Add rate-limiting to the endpoint to prevent brute force attacks. Here's how you can do it with the `express-rate-limit` library.

```javascript
const rateLimit = require("express-rate-limit");

const limiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 3, // limit each IP to 3 requests per windowMs
  message: "Too many password reset attempts from this IP, please try again after 15 minutes."
});

// apply to all requests
app.post('/reset_password', limiter, function(req, res) {
  // your code
});
```
### Step 3: Implement Strong User Authentication
Strong user authentication methods, such as multi-factor authentication or CAPTCHA on the password reset page, can further secure the endpoint.
