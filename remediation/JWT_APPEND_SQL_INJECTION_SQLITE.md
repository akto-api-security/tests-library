## Remediation Steps for SQL Injection test on JWT for SQLite
SQL Injection is a serious security issue. Without properly validating and encoding input, an attacker might be able to manipulate SQL queries in malicious ways. 

SQL injection in JWT could lead to authentication bypass leading to unauthorized access to sensitive information. SQL injection attacks are possible because of dynamic construction of SQL queries, primarily because of end user input that isn't correctly checked.

### Step 1: Parameterized Queries
Use Parameterized Queries rather than string concatenation. The values are replaced in the compiled SQL statement using placeholders (`?`), which makes the process safe against SQL injection.

Here is an example in Python:

```python
import sqlite3
conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db')
c = conn.cursor()

# Using Parameterized Queries
name = ('John Doe',)
c.execute("SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name=?", name)
```

### Step 2: Use ORM Tools
Using ORM (Object Relational Mapping) tools can also protect against SQL injection. These tools usually handle all database queries for you and have built-in SQL injection protection. Examples of some ORM tools include Hibernate for Java, Sequelize for JavaScript and SQLAlchemy for Python.

### Step 3: Limit Database Permissions
Practice the principle of least privilege. Limit the access rights of the account your app uses to connect to the database. Even if an attacker finds an injection point, they would have restricted capabilities.

### Step 4: Validate JWT
The JWT (JSON Web Tokens) should be validated properly. Never trust user input, always validate it on the server-side.

```javascript
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
const token = 'your token';
const secret = 'your secret key';

// Verifying a token
jwt.verify(token, secret, function(err, decoded) {
  console.error(err);
  console.log(decoded);
});
```
