## Remediation Steps for Htpasswd Information Leak

Htpasswd information leaks can expose password details, therefore potentially granting unauthorized access to attackers. The Htpasswd file, commonly used in Apache-based web servers, should never be accessible by any untrusted parties.

Following are the remediation steps:

### Step 1: Disallow access to htpasswd files
Using an '.htaccess' file, you can set permissions to disallow direct access to the htpasswd file on Apache servers. In '.htaccess' file, add:

```bash
<Files ".ht*">
    Order allow,deny
    Deny from all
</Files>
```

This rule tells the Apache Web Server to deny any http requests for files that start with ".ht".

### Step 2: Move htpasswd file out of public directory
Another important security measure is to store the '.htpasswd' file outside of the web-root directory to minimize the data exposure risk.

```bash
mv /path/to/public_html/.htpasswd /path/to/some_other_directory/
```
After moving the htpasswd file, remember to update the AuthUserFile directive in your .htaccess file with the new path of .htpasswd file.

### Step 3: Set correct file permissions 
Ensure that the file permissions are correctly set on the htpasswd file to avoid unauthorized access. Only the owner of the file (usually the webserver) should have permissions to read or write to the file.

```bash
chmod 660 /path/to/your/.htpasswd
```
This grants read and write permissions to the owner and group, but no permissions to anyone else.
