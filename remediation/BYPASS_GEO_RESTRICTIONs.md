## Remediation Steps for Bypass Geo-Restrictions
Bypassing Geo-Restrictions is a security issue often leveraged by attackers to gain unauthorized access to content, data or services in regions where they are not physically located. Properly implementing Geo-restrictions can prevent unauthorized access.

### Step 1: Implement IP Address Based Geo-restrictions
Geo-restrictions can be typically enforced by detecting the IP address of the client and checking if it is within the range of IP addresses that are allowed for a particular region. This could be achieved with using web server configurations or Cloud-based security services.

#### Using Nginx web server example:
```bash
location / {
    if ($allowed_country ~ (country code) ) {
        return 403;
    }
}
```
You need to replace `country code` with ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code that you want to block or allow. But remember, Nginx does not support GeoIP module natively, you need to install it separately.

#### Using AWS WAF example:
```json
{
  "Name": "GeoMatchSet", 
  "ChangeToken": "abc123", 
  "GeoMatchSet": {
    "GeoMatchConstraints": [
      {
        "Type": "Country", 
        "Value": "US"
      }
    ], 
    "Name": "GeoMatchSet", 
    "GeoMatchSetId": "abc1a1-a1bc-a1b2-a1b2-a1bc12ab12ab"
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Block VPN and Proxy Services
Many times, users use VPN and proxies to bypass Geo-restrictions. Blocking known VPN and proxy services can also help prevent bypass of geo-restrictions. 

There are commercial databases available that provide lists of IP addresses that belong to known VPN and proxy services, which can be used to block requests. Please note that not all VPN and proxy services can be reliably detected or blocked.
