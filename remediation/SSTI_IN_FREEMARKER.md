# Remediation for SSTI_IN_FREEMARKER

## Remediation Steps for SSTI in Freemarker
Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) in Freemarker is a serious vulnerability. Without addressing this issue, an attacker could inject malicious code that can be executed on the server.

Freemarker doesn't have built-in measures to prevent SSTI, so you must manually ensure any data being used in your templates is safe from injection. One common method is to escape user-provided data before using it within any templates. 

### Step 1: Validate Input
Take precautions to validate input before incorporating it in your templates.

```java
public String validateInput(String input) {
    if (input == null || input.isEmpty()) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Input cannot be null or empty!");
    }
    return input;
}
```
### Step 2: Use RawPrint Instead of String Interpolation
Avoid using string interpolation when dealing with user-provided data. Instead, use raw print which won't evaluate any expressions.

```java
<#-- BAD -->
${userInput}

<#-- GOOD -->
<@s.rawprint userInput />
```
### Step 3: Use a Secure Template Method
Use a method to handle user-provided data securely when creating templates.

```java
public Template createSecureTemplate(String input) {
    String safeInput = validateInput(input);
    return new Template("SecureTemplate", new StringReader(safeInput), configuration);
}
```
### Step 4: Regular Code Audit
Always make sure to conduct regular code audits and updates to ensure the effectiveness of all safety measures.
```bash
git pull origin main
```
Remember that these steps alone are not sufficient to protect your application from all security threats. Always adhere to best practices for secure coding in your specific environment and language.
