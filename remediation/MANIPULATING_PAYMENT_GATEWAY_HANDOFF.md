# Remediation for MANIPULATING_PAYMENT_GATEWAY_HANDOFF

## Remediation Steps for Manipulating Payment Gateway Handoff
Manipulating Payment Gateway Handoff is a serious security issue. In a web application, secure handling of payment transactions is vital to maintain trust and integrity. The issue can be remediated by ensuring that transaction data is immutable and by verifying the transaction data both before and after the transaction.

### Step 1: Parameter verification

Implementing backend validation for transaction parameters can help prevent the manipulation of parameters. 

This can be done on the server-side, for example:

```PHP
<?php
    $input_amount = $_POST['amount'];
    
    if($input_amount != $actual_amount) {
        die("Invalid transaction data. Transaction terminated.");
    }
``` 
### Step 2: Use Secure and Trusted Payment Gateways

Always use verified and trusted payment gateways. Ensure the gateway has multiple layers of security and follows required compliance standards.

### Step 3: Implement Hashing

Hash transaction data and pass the hash along with the data to the payment gateway. When the gateway sends the data back, hash the data again and check if the new hash matches the original one. Consider using a strong hashing algorithm like SHA-256.

```PHP
<?php
    $data = serialize($transaction_data);
    $hash = hash('sha256', $data.$your_secret_key);

    // Send $hash and $data to payment gateway

    // On response
    $returned_data = $_POST['transaction_data'];
    $returned_hash = $_POST['hash'];

    if($returned_hash != hash('sha256', $returned_data.$your_secret_key)) {
        die('Data has been manipulated. Transaction terminated.');
    }
```
### Step 4: Use HTTPS for data transmission

Configuring an SSL certificate for your website to ensure data transmitted between the client side and server side is encrypted.

An SSL certificate can be installed from the server-side:

```bash
sudo a2enmod ssl
sudo service apache2 restart
```
