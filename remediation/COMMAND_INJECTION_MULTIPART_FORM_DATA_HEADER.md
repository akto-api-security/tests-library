# Remediation for COMMAND_INJECTION_MULTIPART_FORM_DATA_HEADER

## Remediation Steps for Command Injection in Content-Type Headers

Command Injection vulnerability might allow an attacker to manipulate the Content-Type headers having Multipart form data value. To prevent this, we need to follow several remediation steps. 

### Step 1: Validate and Sanitize Input 

Firstly, we should validate and sanitize the input from the client side. You could do this with a middleware such as express-validator for Node.js.

```javascript
const { check } = require('express-validator');

app.use([
  check('Content-Type').isIn(['multipart/form-data']), 
]);

```

This will ensure that only `multipart/form-data` Content-Type is allowed in the request. 

### Step 2: Parametrized Commands 

Avoid the use of command interpreters when possible. If needed, use an API which supports parameterized commands to prevent the command from being manipulated. 

```java
String [] cmd = { "/bin/ls", "-l", "/home/user" };
Runtime.getRuntime().exec(cmd);
```

### Step 3: Denylist Unwanted Sequences

Implement a denylist for unwanted sequences such as '`;`', '`&&`', or '`||`' which could be used for command chaining. Here's an example in Python.

```python
def sanitize(input):
    denylist = [';', '&&', '||']
    for item in denylist:
        if item in input:
            raise ValueError('Invalid character in input')
    # Process input...
```

### Step 4: User Permissions and Privilege Elevation

Ensure that the software is running with the minimum rights necessary in order to function. This limits the damage that can be done through a command injection.

You can adjust these settings in the software's documentation or relevant configuration files.

### Step 5: Regular Audit and Update

Update your application regularly, and also review the code informally for vulnerabilities related to command injection. This will catch many cases of potential command injection and allow you to patch them before they become security issues.

**Note:** These steps are not exhaustive and may not completely eliminate all risks associated with command injection, but they are a good starting point for securing your application.
