# Remediation for COMMAND_INJECTION_SYS_INFO_RETRIEVAL

## Remediation Steps for Command Injection for System Info Retrieval
Command injection is a security vulnerability that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the host operating system via a vulnerable application. This security breach can be managed by adopting several measures.

### Step 1: Use Safe APIs
If possible, use safe APIs catering to your specific needs, avoiding the execution of commands. For instance, in Java, you can use `Runtime.exec()` to execute system commands and retrieve information, which is potentially insecure. Instead, one could use the standard Java API methods:
```java
File file = new File("/path/to/directory");
String[] fileList = file.list();
```
### Step 2: Input Validation
Implement a strong input validation mechanism. Reject any inputs that contain suspicious values such as command injection identifiers `&&`, `||`, `;`, etc.
```python
import re

suspicious_pattern = re.compile(r'[;&|]')
user_input = input()
if suspicious_pattern.search(user_input):
    print('Invalid input')
```
### Step 3: Use Parameterized Queries
Avoid using string concatenation to create commands. Use parameterized queries to prevent command injection.
```javascript
const child_process = require('child_process');

let user_input = 'ls'; // some user input
child_process.execFile(user_input, function(err, data) {
   console.log(data);
});
```
### Step 4: Use Principle of Least Privilege
Run your applications with the least privileges possible. Even a successful command injection will do less harm if the compromised process has limited privileges.
```bash
# Create a new user with limited privileges
sudo adduser --no-create-home --disabled-login --gecos "" limiteduser

# Run the application using the limiteduser
sudo -u limiteduser the-application
```
By integrating these practices, you limit the risk of command injection attacks on your application, creating a more robust software environment.
