# Remediation for TIME_BASED_SQLI_SQLITE_POST

## Remediation Steps for Time Based SQL Injection in SQLITE DB for POST method APIs

Time based SQL Injection is a serious vulnerability, where manipulation of an SQL query can lead to unauthorized data access, data manipulation or even data loss.

### Step 1: Parameterize SQL Queries

Use parameterized SQL queries to prevent SQL injection attacks. Parameterization ensures that the parameters (i.e., inputs) passed into SQL statements are treated strictly as data, not as part of the SQL command.

Here is an example of a parameterized query in Python using **sqlite3**:

```python
import sqlite3
con = sqlite3.connect('my_database.db')
cur = con.cursor()

# unsafe query
#cur.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '%s'" % name)

# safe (parameterized) query
cur.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE name=?", (name,))

con.close()
```

### Step 2: Implement Input Validation

Enforce good input validation. Check your application's inputs for illegal characters or other anomalies that may indicate an attack.

```python
import re

def validate_input(user_input):
    pattern = re.compile("^[a-zA-Z0-9_]*$")
    return pattern.match(user_input)
```

### Step 3: Limit Database Permissions

Limit the permissions of the database account used by your application. Don't use the default root or admin account. Create a new account with minimal read and write permissions necessary for the application to function.

This can be done with the following SQL command:

```sql
sqlite> CREATE USER 'newuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
sqlite> GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON my_database.* TO 'newuser'@'localhost';
sqlite> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

### Step 4: Regular Audit and Update

Ensure that your application is regularly updated with latest security patches and updates. Implement proper error handling so that no detailed error messages containing information about your database are revealed.

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
```

This is not an exhaustive list of remedies but it will help reduce the susceptibility of your APIs to Time Based SQL Injection attacks.
