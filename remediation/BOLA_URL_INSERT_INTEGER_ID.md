# Remediation for BOLA_URL_INSERT_INTEGER_ID

## Remediation Steps for Exploiting BOLA by inserting Integer IDs in URL Path

Broken Object Level Authorization, or BOLA, is a serious security issue where integers or other identifiers are exploited to access unauthorized data through an API's path or request parameters. The following are steps to patch and prevent these exploitations.

### Step 1: Implement Proper Access Control
Firstly, never rely solely on user-supplied object IDs for access control, as a malicious user may manipulate them to gain unauthorized access. Instead, implement proper server-side access control checks for each resource a user attempts to access.

For example, in Python with a Flask application, ensure that user access control is carried out before any database operation:

```python
@app.route('/api/resource/<int:id>', methods=['GET'])
@token_required
def get_resource(current_user, id):
    resource = Resource.query.get_or_404(id)
    
    if resource.owner_id != current_user.id:
        return jsonify({"message": "You don't have access to this resource!"}), 403

    return jsonify(resource.serialize())
```

In the above example, a middleware `@token_required` validates the user, and in the `get_resource` function, checks if the current user is the actual owner of the resource before providing the resource data.

### Step 2: Use a Map of References to Actual Objects
You should have a database table, which includes the mapping between user IDs and the resource IDs they can access. Then, each time a request is performed, validate if a mapping is present for the given user-resource pair.

```python
@app.route('/api/user/<int:user_id>/resource/<int:resource_id>', methods=['GET'])
def read_user_wiki(user_id, resource_id):
    mapping = UserResourceMapping.query.filter_by(user_id=user_id, resource_id=resource_id).first()

    if not mapping:
        abort(403)

    return jsonify(mapping.resource.serialize())
```

### Step 3: Use UUIDs instead of simple Integer IDs
Using UUIDs instead of simple Integer IDs makes it difficult for attackers to guess the identifiers, thereby mitigating IDOR or BOLA attacks. You can replace Integer IDs with UUIDs in your database as well as your URL paths to further discourage BOLA attacks.

While UUIDs can add additional security, it is important to note that they should not be your only security measure â€“ they should be used in conjunction with the other steps detailed above. 

```python
import uuid

class Resource(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.String(36), primary_key=True, default=lambda: str(uuid.uuid4()))

@app.route('/api/resource/<string:id>', methods=['GET'])
@token_required
def get_resource(current_user, id):
    resource = Resource.query.get_or_404(id)
    
    if resource.owner_id != current_user.id:
        return jsonify({"message": "You don't have access to this resource!"}), 403

    return jsonify(resource.serialize())
```
