# Remediation for UNAUTHORIZED_WEBSOCKET_UPGRADE

## Remediation Steps for Unauthorized WebSocket Upgrade

Unauthorized WebSocket Upgrade presents a serious security threat, allowing potential attackers to communicate privately with your server. This can lead to data breaches, server crashes, or worse. It is therefore critical to prevent that.

### Step 1: Validate Upgrade Headers
Check whether an incoming upgrade request is actually from WebSocket or not. Do not let any unknown protocol upgrades. 

Here is sample code you'd use in Node.js with Express:

```javascript
app.use((req, res, next) => {
    if (req.headers.upgrade !== 'websocket') {
        return next();
    }
    // continue with WebSocket upgrade
});
```

### Step 2: Authorization Checks
Use authentication middleware to check whether the user is permitted to make a WebSocket connection. This also could be done at the time of WebSocket handshake. Here is an example in Node.js:

```javascript
const WebSocket = require('ws');

const wss = new WebSocket.Server({ noServer: true });

wss.on('connection', function connection(ws, req) {
  if (!req.user || !req.user.authorized) {
    ws.close();
    return;
  }
  // continue with connection
});
```

### Step 3: Limit Origins
Limit the origins that are permitted to make a WebSocket connection. This will mitigate cross-site WebSocket hijacking.

Here is an example in Python using Tornado:

```python
import tornado.websocket

class MyWebSocketHandler(tornado.websocket.WebSocketHandler):
    def check_origin(self, origin):
        return origin in ['http://mydomain1', 'http://mydomain2']
```

### Step 4: Regular Audit and Update
Ensure that WebSocket libraries and dependencies are updated regularly to prevent security vulnerabilities. Include this maintenance in your regular codebase auditing.
