# Remediation for BOOLEAN_MASS_ASSIGN_DYNAMIC_WORDLIST_EXPLOIT

## Remediation Steps for Mass Assignment Vulnerability via Boolean Values in API Data

Mass assignment vulnerability is a serious security issue in which an attacker is able to set arbitrary values on your model's attributes or even nested attributes. This can happen when the developer unintentionally exposes all the model attributes in the API and they can be modified with the incoming API data. 

The steps below, written specifically for Ruby on Rails but applicable across many languages, show how to handle the mass assignment vulnerability. 

### Step 1: Always List Accessible Attributes

You should explicitly list out attributes that should be accessible for mass-assignment. In Rails, you can do this using `attr_accessible` within your model.

```ruby
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  attr_accessible :name, :email
end
```

In this case, only `name` and `email` can be modified in a mass assignment call. Any attempt to assign values to unlisted attributes will fail.

### Step 2: Use Strong Parameters

Since Rails 4, strong parameters replaced `attr_accessible` and `attr_protected` as the primary means of handling mass assignment. 

Strong parameters allow you to deny unexpected or unwanted data in the controller, rather than in the model. This keeps data handling centralized in the controller and prevents unlisted data from being written to the database.

```ruby
def create
  @user = User.new(user_params)
  if @user.save
    redirect_to @user
  else
    render 'new'
  end
end
 
private
  def user_params
    params.require(:user).permit(:name, :email)
  end
```
In this case, `user_params` requires the `user` parameter and permits `name` and `email` while denying everything else.

### Step 3: Regularly Review and Update Accessible Attributes

Periodically review your model's accessible attributes. As your application's requirements change, you might add new attributes to your model. Be sure to update the accessible attributes list as needed.

```ruby
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  attr_accessible :name, :email, :phone
end
```
or in the case of using strong parameters:

```ruby
def user_params
  params.require(:user).permit(:name, :email, :phone)
end
```
In both examples, a new `phone` attribute that was added to the User model was also added to the list of attributes that can be assigned en masse. 

Following these steps will help prevent mass assignment vulnerabilities via boolean values in your API data.
