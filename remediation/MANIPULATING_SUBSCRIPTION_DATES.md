# Remediation for MANIPULATING_SUBSCRIPTION_DATES

## Remediation Steps for Manipulating Subscription Dates for Trial Extensions

Manipulating subscription dates to extend trial periods is a common security issue that may cause significant revenue losses. If the trial start and end dates are stored insecurely, an attacker could potentially modify these, extending their trial indefinitely.

To remediate this issue, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Server-Side Validation 
Ensure dates are validated on the server-side and not only on the client-side. 

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

def validate_trial_dates(trial_start_date, trial_end_date):
    if trial_end_date - trial_start_date != timedelta(days=14):
        raise ValueError("Invalid trial date, trial should last only 14 days")

validate_trial_dates(datetime.now(), datetime.now() + timedelta(days=15))
```

### Step 2: User Permissions 
Make sure that users don't have the permission to adjust their trial dates directly in the database.

Example RDBMS privilege restrictions (in SQL):

```sql
REVOKE UPDATE ON obj TO user
```

### Step 3: Maintain an Audit Log
Keep a record of when the trial starts and when it's supposed to end and have it be reviewed periodically. This allows you to catch any funny business early.

```python
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger("audit")
logger.info("Trial started at %s and is expected to end at %s", trial_start_date, trial_end_date)
```
### Step 4: Regular Software and Infrastructure Updates
Ensure timely software and infrastructure updates to ensure youâ€™re always using the most secure versions of your technology stack.

Please also review and conduct regular security audits across your platforms to identify and resolve any security vulnerabilities on a continuous basis.
