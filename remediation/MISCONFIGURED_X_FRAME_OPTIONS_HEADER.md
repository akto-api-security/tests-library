# Remediation for MISCONFIGURED_X_FRAME_OPTIONS_HEADER

## Remediation Steps for Misconfigured X-Frame-Options Header
A misconfigured X-Frame-Options header can lead to attacks such as Clickjacking. The attacker tricks the user into clicking something different from what the user perceives, potentially revealing confidential information or taking control of the user's actions. To prevent this threat, it is important to properly configure this header.

### Step 1: Set X-Frame-Options Header

#### For Apache server: 
You should set this at the httpd.conf file or inside the virtual host file.

```bash
<IfModule mod_headers.c>
    Header set X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN"
</IfModule>
```
Then restart your Apache service.

```bash
sudo service apache2 restart
```

#### For Nginx server:
Include the add_header directive in the configuration file.
```bash
add_header X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN";
```
Then restart your Nginx service.

```bash
sudo service nginx restart
```

#### For Express server (Node.js):
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.use((req, res, next) => {
  res.header('X-Frame-Options', 'SAMEORIGIN');
  next();
});

app.listen(3000);
```

### Step 2: Test for Correct Configuration
Ensure that your website's X-Frame Options Header is correctly set up by inspecting your website's HTTP response headers. There are various tools online for this, including Google's [Security Headers](https://securityheaders.com/) check. 

The X-Frame-Options should be set to "SAMEORIGIN" or "DENY" to prevent your website from being framed and therefore defend against potential Clickjacking attacks.

Note: "SAMEORIGIN" will allow the page to be framed by the site itself, while "DENY" will prevent any framing activities. Choose the best one according to your needs. 

### Step 3: Regular Audit and Update
It's important to regularly audit your headers and update them as per your application's requirement and security guidelines to ensure ongoing protection from threats. 

Ensure to test your application after each change to verify nothing broke because of the change.
