## Remediation Steps for Manipulating XML Vulnerability
Manipulating XML is a serious security issue. If not properly handled, it may lead to information disclosure, denial of service, server side request forgery, port scanning from the perspective of the machine where the parser is located, and other system impacts.

Here are some steps to remediate XML External Entity (XXE) which is a common way XML manipulation can be exploited. We'll cover remediation in Java using a secure XML parser, but similar steps can be applied in different languages.

### Step 1: Disable DTDs (Document Type Definitions)
Java's default XML parsers support DTDs which can be used to define XML markup and potentially cause XXE vulnerabilities. DTDs should be disabled for a secure configuration.

```java
DocumentBuilderFactory dbf = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();
String FEATURE = null;

try {
    // Disable DTDs
    FEATURE = "http://apache.org/xml/features/disallow-doctype-decl";
    dbf.setFeature(FEATURE, true);
} catch (ParserConfigurationException e) {
    // Handling Exception
}
```

### Step 2: Disable External Entities
External entities can be used to disclose internal files using the file URI handler, internal file shares, internal port scanning, etc. This should be disabled as well.

```java
try {
    // Disable external entities
    FEATURE = "http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities";
    dbf.setFeature(FEATURE, false);

    FEATURE = "http://xml.org/sax/features/external-parameter-entities";
    dbf.setFeature(FEATURE, false);

    FEATURE = "http://apache.org/xml/features/nonvalidating/load-external-dtd";
    dbf.setFeature(FEATURE, false);

    dbf.setXIncludeAware(false);
    dbf.setExpandEntityReferences(false);

} catch (ParserConfigurationException e) {
    // Handling Exception
}
```

### Step 3: Secure Configuration of XML Parser
Combine the previous steps into a secure configuration of the XML parser.

```java
DocumentBuilderFactory dbf = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();
String FEATURE = null;

try {
    // This is the PRIMARY defense. If DTDs (doctypes) are disallowed, almost all XML entity attacks are prevented
    // Xerces 2 only - http://xerces.apache.org/xerces2-j/features.html#disallow-doctype-decl
    FEATURE = "http://apache.org/xml/features/disallow-doctype-decl";
    dbf.setFeature(FEATURE, true);

    // If you can't completely disable DTDs, then at least do the following:
    // Xerces 1 - http://xerces.apache.org/xerces-j/features.html#external-general-entities
    // Xerces 2 - http://xerces.apache.org/xerces2-j/features.html#external-general-entities
    // JDK7+ - http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities    
    FEATURE = "http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities";
    dbf.setFeature(FEATURE, false);

    // Xerces 1 - http://xerces.apache.org/xerces-j/features.html#external-parameter-entities
    // Xerces 2 - http://xerces.apache.org/xerces2-j/features.html#external-parameter-entities
    // JDK7+ - http://xml.org/sax/features/external-parameter-entities
    FEATURE = "http://xml.org/sax/features/external-parameter-entities";
    dbf.setFeature(FEATURE, false);

    // Disable external DTDs as well
    FEATURE = "http://apache.org/xml/features/nonvalidating/load-external-dtd";
    dbf.setFeature(FEATURE, false);

    // and these as well, per Timothy Morgan's 2014 paper: "XML Schema, DTD, and Entity Attacks" (see reference below)
    dbf.setXIncludeAware(false);
    dbf.setExpandEntityReferences(false);

    // And, per Timothy Morgan: "If for some reason support for inline DOCTYPEs are a requirement, then 
    // ensure the entity settings are disabled (as shown above) and beware that SSRF attacks
    // (http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/918.html) and denial 
    // of service attacks (such as billion laughs or decompression bombs via "jar:") are a risk."

    // remaining parser logic
    ...
} catch (ParserConfigurationException e) {
    // This should catch a failed setFeature feature
    System.out.println("ParserConfigurationException was thrown. The feature '" +
                                FEATURE + "' is probably not supported by your XML processor.");
}
```
Remember, the trust boundaries of the application should be kept in mind while applying these mitigations.
