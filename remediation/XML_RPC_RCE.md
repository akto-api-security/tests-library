## Remediation Steps for XML-RPC Server Remote Code Execution
XML-RPC Server Remote Code Execution is a serious security vulnerability. This vulnerability allows attackers to remotely execute commands/actions in your server/application, leading to potential unauthorized data access or system compromise.

### Step 1: Disable XML-RPC if not Required
If your application doesn't rely on XML-RPC, consider disabling it altogether. Below is an example of how to disable XML-RPC in a WordPress PHP application:

```php
add_filter('xmlrpc_enabled', '__return_false');
```

### Step 2: Use Plugins or Libraries
If you need to use XML-RPC, consider using plugins or libraries that provide extra security measures. Make sure that these plugins/libraries are actively maintained and trusted by the community.

For WordPress, the `Disable XML-RPC` plugin can be used:

```php
function disable_xmlrpc( $methods ) {
   unset( $methods['system.multicall'] );
   return $methods;
}
add_filter( 'xmlrpc_methods', 'disable_xmlrpc' );
```

### Step 3: Limit Access
Limit access to the XML-RPC server to only the necessary IP addresses. You can do this using .htaccess in Apache or the configuration file in Nginx:

Apache:
```apache
<Files xmlrpc.php>
    order deny,allow
    deny from all
    allow from 192.0.2.0/24
</Files>
```
Nginx:
```nginx
location = /xmlrpc.php {
    allow 192.0.2.0/24;
    deny all;
}
```
Replace `192.0.2.0/24` with the actual IP range.
