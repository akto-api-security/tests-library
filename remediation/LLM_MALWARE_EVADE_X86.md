## Remediation Steps for Overreliance on LLMs - Evading Anti-Malware with x86 Assembly Code

The issue of Overreliance on LLMs and evading anti-malware with x86 assembly code is a significant security concern. Without proper measures, an attacker may inject malicious x86 assembly code into your application, which could lead to serious problems, including data breaches, unauthorized access, and more.

### Step 1: Use High-Level Languages 

Avoid using low-level languages (LLMs) like Assembly for critical operations where possible. High-level languages (HLLs) come with much stronger security features that make it harder to inject malicious code.
```bash
//Use a high-level language such as Python, JavaScript or Java
```

### Step 2: Security Through Code Review

Conduct regular, thorough code reviews to detect any presence of x86 Assembly code. This could be done manually by a human or automated with a tool.
```bash
//Use tools like SonarQube for automatic code review
```

### Step 3: Dynamic Analysis

Implement dynamic analysis tools in your CI/CD pipeline. These tools will help detect runtime injections of malicious x86 Assembly code.
```bash
//Use dynamic analysis tools as part of your CI/CD pipeline
```

### Step 4: Least Privilege Principle

Modify the execution permissions for your applications according to the principle of least privilege. This restricts the application's ability to execute harmful operations.

```bash
//Change the execution permissions using chmod
sudo chmod u-x /path/to/application
```
