# Remediation for GIT_CREDENTIALS_DISCLOSURE

## Remediation Steps for Git Credentials Disclosure

Git Credentials Disclosure is a potent security vulnerability. If Git credentials are disclosed unintentionally, attackers can gain unauthorized access to the codebase, which can lead to serious issues like code tampering, data leakage, and more.

### Step 1: Remove Git Credentials from Code or Configuration Files

First, you should ensure that Git credentials are not hardcoded in any files in your repository. Check your code and configuration files to ensure no credentials are exposed.

```bash
# Search for credentials in codebase
grep -rnw '/path/to/your/repo' -e 'username' -e 'password'
```

### Step 2: Remove Git Credentials from Git History

After removing credentials from the repository, you should also remove them from the Git history. You can do this using BFG Repo-Cleaner or the `filter-branch` command in Git.

```bash
# Using BFG Repo-Cleaner
bfg --delete-files YOURFILE your-repo.git

# Using filter-branch
git filter-branch --force --index-filter \
  "git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch PATH-TO-YOUR-FILE-WITH-SENSITIVE-DATA" \
  --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all
```

### Step 3: Use Safe Storage Mechanisms for Git Credentials

Avoid storing credentials in your repository. Instead, consider using secure storage mechanisms such as Git Credential Manager, environment variables, or secret management systems like Vault.

```bash
# Storing credentials with Git Credential Manager
git config --global credential.helper manager
```
