# Remediation for SENSITIVE_DATA_EXPOSURE_NGROK_API

## Remediation Steps for NGROK API's Sensitive Data Exposure
Sensitive data exposure via NGROK API is a serious security issue. Without proper safeguards, attackers may gain unauthorized access to sensitive information, leading to serious implications.

### Step 1: Encrypt all sensitive data
Use strong, industry-approved encryption algorithms to protect sensitive data both at rest and in transit. Avoid custom encryption methods.

### Step 2: Restrict API access
Limit the exposure of your NGROK API to reduce the attack surface. This can be done by IP whitelisting and implementing strict access controls.

### Step 3: Use secure connections
Always use a secure and encrypted connection (HTTPS/TLS) when making a call to your API. This can be ensured in NGROK setup like below in Python.

```python
from pyngrok import ngrok

public_url = ngrok.connect('8000', options={"bind_tls": True})
print(public_url)
```

### Step 4: Use API keys or tokens
 to verify every request. Never expose your NGROK API Key in the code or version control systems.

```python
from pyngrok import ngrok, conf

# Update with your API Key
conf.get_default().api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY'

public_url = ngrok.connect('8000')
print(public_url)
```
