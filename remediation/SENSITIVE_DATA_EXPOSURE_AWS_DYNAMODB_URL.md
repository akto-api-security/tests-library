# Remediation for SENSITIVE_DATA_EXPOSURE_AWS_DYNAMODB_URL

## Remediation Steps for AWS DynamoDB Sensitive Data Exposure

Sensitive data exposure in AWS DynamoDB URL is a serious security issue. Attackers can misuse exposed URLs to gain unauthorized access to the stored data resulting in severe data breaches.

### Step 1: Do not embed credentials in URLs

Embedding credentials or sensitive data in URLs can expose them in the browser history, bookmarks, or even when sharing links. Ensure that your URL construction does not include embedding credentials or other sensitive information.

```python
# Don't do this
url = "https://ACCESS_KEY_ID:SECRET_ACCESS_KEY@dynamodb.us-west-2.amazonaws.com"
```

### Step 2: Use IAM Roles for Access Control

Use the IAM roles which enable you to grant certain permissions for the AWS resource access. AWS SDK will handle the secure delivery of your credentials automatically.

```python
import boto3

# Instantiate a new DynamoDB client
dynamodb = boto3.resource('dynamodb')

# Your application code goes here after client is initialized
```

### Step 3: Encrypt AWS Credentials 

Keep your AWS credentials encrypted and securely stored in a place where your application can access them.

```bash
# Install AWS CLI
pip install awscli

# Configure the AWS CLI
aws configure
```

When the CLI asks for each value, provide your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, and Default region name but do so securely without exposing these details.
