# Remediation for PARAMETER_MANIPULATION_STRING_MANIPULATION

## Remediation Steps for Parameter Manipulation by String Manipulation in Transactions

Parameter manipulation by string manipulation in transactions is a serious security issue, often a result of inadequate sanitization/validation of user inputs. Attackers may modify the application behaviour by tampering the parameters. Here are the steps to mitigate the issue:

### Step 1: Sanitize User Input
Always sanitize and validate all user inputs before processing them. This will help prevent any potential anomalies induced by the manipulation of parameters. Below is a Python example:

```python
from django.core.exceptions import ValidationError

def sanitize_user_input(input):
    if 'unwanted_string' in input:
        raise ValidationError("Error: Invalid input detected")
    else:
        validated_input = input
    return validated_input
```

### Step 2: Use Prepared Statements
Using Prepared Statements can help in preventing parameter manipulation attacks. Below is an example in SQL:

```sql
PREPARE stmt_name FROM @sql;
EXECUTE stmt_name;
DEALLOCATE PREPARE stmt_name;
```

### Step 3: Input Parameterization
Parameterize all inputs to handle them in a safe manner. An example can be seen below in Python using Psycopg2:

```python
import psycopg2

# Connect to the database
conn = psycopg2.connect("dbname=test user=postgres password=secret")

# Open a cursor to perform database operations
cur = conn.cursor()

# Parameterize query
cur.execute("INSERT INTO test (num, data) VALUES (%s, %s)",
      (100, "abc'def"))

# Commit the transaction
conn.commit()

# Close the cursor and connection
cur.close()
conn.close()
```

### Step 4: Regular Audit and Update
Schedule regular audits to ensure the integrity of your application and update as necessary.

In conclusion, while parameter manipulation cannot be completely eradicated, it can be effectively mitigated through proper input sanitization, using prepared statements, input parameterization, and regular audits.
