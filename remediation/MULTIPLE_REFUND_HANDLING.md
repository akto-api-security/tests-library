## Remediation Steps for Exchange or Return Fraud via Filling Multiple Refunds

Exchange or Return fraud, especially filling multiple refunds, is a significant concern for many e-commerce websites and/or applications. It is not merely a technological violation but also a business process abuse that can lead to substantial losses.

### Step 1: Enable Request Pattern Monitoring
To avoid such fraudulent activities, it's useful to adopt measures like request pattern monitoring. By setting up pattern recognition algorithms or utilizing pre-built services, the system can be trained to detect unusual patterns of activity, such as recurring refund requests for the same item from a given user. 

```python
# Python pseudocode

from pattern_recognition_module import monitor_requests

def is_suspicious(user, item):
    request_history = monitor_requests(user, item)
    if request_history.count() > threshold: # Threshold to be defined based on business rules
        return True
    return False
```

### Step 2: Implement Limitations on Refunds
It's also important to introduce specific rules that limit the total number of returns or refunds a single user can make within a particular timeframe, or put a monetary limit on refunds.

```python
# Python pseudocode

def can_request_refund(user, amount):
    if user.total_returned_value_within_period(timeframe) + amount > monetary_limit:
        return False
    return True
```

### Step 3: Introduce Enhanced User Verification 
To overcome the problem of users abusing the system by creating multiple accounts, introduce an enhanced user verification process during account creation. This process could involve mobile number verification and/or KYC (Know Your Customer) process, and additional anti-bot measures like CAPTCHA.
