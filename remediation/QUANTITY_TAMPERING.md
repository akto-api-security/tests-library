# Remediation for QUANTITY_TAMPERING

## Remediation Steps for Input Validation Using Quantity Tampering

Input Validation using Quantity Tampering is a serious security issue where an attacker can manipulate the quantity of an item in a shopping cart and buy it for a lower price, causing financial loss.

To mitigate this vulnerability, it is necessary to validate inputs server-side, limit session time, and ensure the integrity of the shopping cart.

Here is how to remediate this issue:

### Step 1: Server-side Input Validation
Running input validation on the server side is crucial as an attacker may bypass client-side restrictions. This could be achieved with PHP code like:

```php
// Assume $quantity is the quantity from the user input
$quantity = $_POST['quantity'];
if (!filter_var($quantity, FILTER_VALIDATE_INT, array('options' => array('min_range' => 1)))) {
  // Invalid quantity, handle the error
  die('Invalid quantity');
} else {
  // Valid quantity, proceed with the transaction
}
```

### Step 2: Limit Session Time
Make sure to limit the duration of sessions to minimize the time window an attacker could exploit. Python Flask library allows to set session duration:

```python
from flask import Flask, session
from datetime import timedelta

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE'] = True
app.config['PERMANENT_SESSION_LIFETIME'] = timedelta(minutes=5)
```

### Step 3: Ensure Shopping Cart Integrity
Always verify the integrity of the shopping cart on the server side before processing the transaction.

```java
public boolean validateCart(Cart cart) {
    double total = 0;

    for (Item item : cart.getItems()) {
        total += item.getQuantity() * item.getPrice();
    }

    if (cart.getTotal() != total) {
        return false; // The integrity of the cart is compromised
    } else {
        return true; // The cart is valid, proceed with the transaction.
    }
}
```
The above steps will enhance the security of the system and make it resilient to quantity tampering attacks. Regular updates and audits should also be considered to ensure the effectiveness of security measures.
