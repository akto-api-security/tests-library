## Remediation Steps for Apache Tomcat Remote Code Execution

Apache Tomcat Remote Code Execution vulnerability can allow an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary code. To securely mitigate this issue, follow the steps below.

### Step 1: Update Apache Tomcat
Ensure Tomcat is up-to-date. Apache regularly releases patches for known vulnerabilities.

```bash
cd /path/to/tomcat/
./bin/version.sh 
```
Confirm the version and then, download and install the latest version patch from the official Apache site.

```bash
wget http://www-us.apache.org/dist/tomcat/tomcat-9/v9.0.39/bin/apache-tomcat-9.0.39.tar.gz
tar xvfz apache*.tar.gz
mv apache-tomcat-9.0.39/* ./ 
rm -Rf apache-tomcat-*
./bin/shutdown.sh 
./bin/startup.sh
```

### Step 2: Restrict Unnecessary Access
Ensure that the access to sensitive directories is restricted. 

```xml
    <Context path="/admin" debug="0" privileged="true">
    <!-- This will prevent any requests to /admin from being processed -->
    <Valve className="org.apache.catalina.valves.RemoteAddrValve"
        allow="127.0.0.1" deny=""/>
    <!-- Configure your Realm here, or remove the element to use the
    default one, as specified for the Host -->
    <Realm className="org.apache.catalina.realm.MemoryRealm" />
    </Context>
```

### Step 3: Enable Security Manager
Enable Security Manager to restrict the permissions of certain operations which can greatly reduce Tomcat's exposure to a successful attack.

```xml
JAVA_OPTS="-Djava.security.manager -Djava.security.policy==conf/catalina.policy"
```
