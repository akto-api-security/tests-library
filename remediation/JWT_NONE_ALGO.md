## Remediation Steps for JWT None Algorithm Vulnerability
The JWT None Algorithm Vulnerability can allow an attacker to bypass the authentication system of an application, leading to unauthorized access to sensitive data.
### Step 1: Avoid Using JWT None Algorithm 
The "none" algorithm in JWT should be avoided for production applications as it doesn't perform any signature verification. 
```javascript
// BAD
const decodedToken = jwt.verify(token, '', {algorithms: ['none']});

// GOOD
const decodedToken = jwt.verify(token, secret, {algorithms: ['HS256']});
```
In the above JavaScript example, the "none" algorithm is replaced by a secure algorithm "HS256". The variable 'secret' acts as the secret key for the encoding algorithm.

### Step 2: Validate the Algorithm 
Always validate the JWT signature with an explicit algorithm. 

```javascript
// VALIDATION EXAMPLE (JavaScript)
jwt.verify(token, secret, {algorithms: ['HS256']}, function(err, decode) {
   if(err) {
      // Handle error
   } else {
      // Continue processing
   }
});
```
In the above JavaScript example, the method jwt.verify() validates JWT token by explicitly setting a secure algorithm "HS256".

### Step 3: Always Update the JWT Library
Ensure that you're always using the latest version of your JWT library since the newer versions are more likely to have the latest security patches and prevent such vulnerabilities. 

### Step 4: Enforce Signature Verification 
Never trust a JWT without verifying its signature. The JWT library should throw an error if the token is not signed with its expecting algorithm.
