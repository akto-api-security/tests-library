## Remediation Steps for Overreliance on LLMs

Test-Dependent on Lower-Level Methods (LLMs) represents a security issue in application testing. The use of LLM tests, bound excessively to the inner workings of methods, could lead to the creation of brittle tests. This situation arises because, as the implementation changes, the connected tests break, even when the behavior remains consistent. This could potentially make an application susceptible to security threats by making the application's behavior unpredictable in certain scenarios.

The overreliance can be mitigated by writing tests that focus on the behavior and outputs of the higher-level methods that call the LLMs, rather than writing tests for the LLMs themselves. 

This will allow the internals of the LLMs to be modified without causing the tests that rely on their behavior to break, as long as the changes do not modify the expected behavior and output of the LLMs.

Here's an example of how to write a test for higher-level methods in C# using NUnit:

```csharp
[TestFixture]
public class HigherLevelMethodTests
{
    private HigherLevelMethod _sut;
    
    [SetUp]
    public void Setup()
    {
        _sut = new HigherLevelMethod(); // Inject dependencies if needed.
    }

    [Test]
    public void Given_ValidConditions_When_MethodCalled_Then_ExpectedResultObtained()
    {
        // Arrange
        var expectedOutput = 123;
        
        // Act
        var result = _sut.PerformOperation();
        
        // Assert
        Assert.AreEqual(expectedOutput, result);
    }
}
```

Replacing an overreliance on LLMs with tests focused on behavior and output, rather than implementation, will generally lead to more resilient tests that are easier to maintain and minimize the risk of security vulnerabilities.

## Process 

### Step 1: Identify test-dependent LLMs
The first step is to identify part of the code that overly rely on the inner workings of methods and replace them with behavior-focused tests.

### Step 2: Write behavior-focused tests
The implementation details could change over time for various reasons such as optimization, refactoring, or changes in requirements. The main idea is to make sure the correct output is obtained when the method is called.

### Step 3: Avoid hardcoded inputs
Avoid hardcoding test input data to avoid direct relationships between specific input data and inner workings of the methods.
