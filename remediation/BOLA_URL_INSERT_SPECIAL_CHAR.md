# Remediation for BOLA_URL_INSERT_SPECIAL_CHAR

## Remediation Steps for BOLA (Broken Object Level Authorization) Exploitation by Inserting Special Characters in URL path

BOLA vulnerabilities allow attackers to bypass authorization methods and access resources directly by modifying the value of identifier such as manipulating ID, UUID, or any data key in the URL path. Therefore, it's crucial to implement proper validation checks to protect sensitive information from unauthorized users.

### Step 1: Validate User Permissions 

Check if the user is authorized to access the data which they are trying to access. Only authorized users should be able to perform sensitive actions. 

```java
// Java code example
if (!userId.equals(authenticatedUser.getId())) {
    throw new AuthorizationException("Access denied");
}
```

### Step 2: Implement Proper Input Validation

Escaping special characters that might be used by an attacker can help in preventing injections. Special characters should be either removed or replaced. 

```java
// Java code example
String cleanUrl = requestUrl.replaceAll("[^a-zA-Z0-9]", "");
```

### Step 3: Use Object References Instead of IDs

Do not expose direct references like database IDs. Use indirect references such as randomly generated tokens or UUIDs that are mapped to the user's session.

```java
// Java code example
UUID objectId = UUID.randomUUID();
```

### Step 4: Consistently Update and Review Access Policies

Regularly review and update security policies to make sure that access controls are sufficient and are functioning as expected.

```bash
# Bash script for a hypothetical policy update
sudo sh update-access-policies.sh
```

### Step 5: Extensive Logging and Monitoring

Keep extensive logs of access to sensitive data and regularly audit them. 

```bash
# Bash script for starting a hypothetical log monitoring service
sudo service log-monitor start
```

Remember to always run tests after implementing these changes to ensure that the changes actually resolve the vulnerability without disrupting other functionalities.
