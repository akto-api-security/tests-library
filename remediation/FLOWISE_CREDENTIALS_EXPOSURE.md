# Remediation for FLOWISE_CREDENTIALS_EXPOSURE

## Remediation Steps for Flowise Credentials Exposure Test
Flowise Credentials Exposure Test is a critical security concern. When Flowise credentials are exposed, it could potentially give unauthorized access to sensitive data and services. The following steps are suggested to remediate this:

### Step 1: Identify The Exposure
Determine where and how the credentials were exposed. Was it through application code, configuration files, or logs?

### Step 2: Rotate Credentials
Rotate the exposed credentials immediately. You can do this by creating a new access key. Here's an example of how to create an access key using the AWS CLI.

```bash
aws iam create-access-key --user-name myuser
```

### Step 3: Update The Credentials Where They're Used
Update the credentials in your application. Where this is done will vary based on how your application is designed. Be sure to do this in a secure way, such as using environment variables instead of hard-coding them into your application.

### Step 4: Invalidate The Exposed Credentials
Once you have confirmed that the new credentials are working, invalidate the exposed credentials. Continuing with the AWS example, here's how to do it:

```bash
aws iam delete-access-key --access-key-id AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE --user-name myuser
```

### Step 5: Implement Policies To Prevent Future Exposure
Determine how the exposure happened and implement policies to prevent future exposures. This could be through code review processes, utilizing secret management tools, or by using minimal privilege principles. 

### Step 6: Regular Audit and Update
Perform regular security audits to ensure no other credentials are exposed and keep your systems updated to prevent potential security vulnerabilities.
