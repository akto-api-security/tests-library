## Remediation Steps for Prometheus Panel Exposure

Prometheus Panel Exposure can potentially allow unauthorized users to monitor or even manipulate any data interacted with via the panel. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure the Prometheus panel is appropriately secured.

### Step 1: Enable Basic Authentication
Prometheus doesn't contain any inherent authentication method. However, we can add a reverse proxy using Nginx and enable HTTP Basic Authentication.

The following example demonstrates how to setup Nginx for reverse proxy:

First, make sure Nginx is installed. Use the following command to install Nginx:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install nginx
```

Create the password file using `htpasswd`. Replace `user_name` with your desired username:

```bash
sudo htpasswd -c /etc/nginx/.htpasswd user_name
```

Now, configure the reverse proxy.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
```
Paste the following content after editing to suit your configuration:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;

    location / {
        auth_basic "Restricted Content";
        auth_basic_user_file /etc/nginx/.htpasswd;
        proxy_pass http://localhost:9090;
    }
}
```
Finally, restart nginx:

```bash
sudo service nginx restart
```

Here, Nginx acts as a reverse proxy adding an authentication layer to Prometheus.

### Step 2: Enable TLS
Prometheus supports TLS. Please refer to the official documentation for implementing TLS in Prometheus.

### Step 3: Network Security Measures
Ensure that your Prometheus server is not publicly accessible and only accessible from machines that require access. This can be achieved using firewall rules that restrict access based on IP address.
