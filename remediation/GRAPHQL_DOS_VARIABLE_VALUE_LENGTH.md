# Remediation for GRAPHQL_DOS_VARIABLE_VALUE_LENGTH

## Remediation Steps for Denial of Service Test on GraphQL API 

Denial of Service (DoS) attacks can immensely harm your GraphQL API service. An attacker would take advantage of the absence of input length validation and flood the service with very long value parts in variable objects in a request. This can lead to the server being overwhelmed and unable to process legitimate requests. 

Follow these steps to mitigate a potential DoS attack exploiting the usage of a very long value part in a GraphQL request.

### Step 1: Input Validation
Firstly, ensure that thorough input validation is implemented and enforced. Discard any requests that contain suspiciously long inputs.

```javascript
// Validate inputs
let input = req.body.input;
if (input.length > maxLength) {
    throw new Error('Input is too long!');
}
```
Replace `maxLength` by the maximum number of characters accepted by your service.

### Step 2: Limit Depth and Complexity of GraphQL Queries
Consider using a library to limit the depth and complexity of the GraphQL queries. For example, you can use the `graphql-depth-limit` and `graphql-validation-complexity` libraries in a Node.js/Express application.

Install the libraries using npm:

```bash
npm install --save graphql-depth-limit graphql-validation-complexity
```

Utilize them in your graphql schema:

```javascript
const depthLimit = require('graphql-depth-limit');
const { createComplexityLimitRule } = require('graphql-validation-complexity');

const schema = makeExecutableSchema({
    typeDefs,
    resolvers,
    validationRules: [depthLimit(5), createComplexityLimitRule(1000)],
});

```
The `5` in `depthLimit(5)` is the maximum depth of your graphql queries. `createComplexityLimitRule(1000)` limits total selection set size to 1000 fields.

### Step 3: Rate Limiting
Implement rate limiting to limit the number of requests a single user (IP address/user account) can send to the server per unit of time. 

```javascript
const rateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');
 
app.use(rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 100 // limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
}));
```
This code will limit each IP to 100 requests per 15 minutes. 

By implementing these remediation steps, you can significantly reduce the risk of a Denial of Service attack on your GraphQL API service.
