## Remediation Steps for Command Injection in User-Agent Header
Command injection in User-Agent Header is a critical security flaw. This issue occurs when an application passes unsafe user supplied data (forms, cookies, HTTP headers, etc.) to a system shell. The issue may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands in the system.

### Step 1: Input Validation
Validate user input before processing. Use a whitelist of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications.
```java
public boolean isValidUserAgent(String userAgent) {
    String whitelist = "regular expression representing the whitelist";
    return userAgent.matches(whitelist);
}
```
### Step 2: Use Parameterized APIs
Most high-level API's provide a method of parameterizing command-line inputs such that they can't be misused for command injection attacks. For example, in Python:
```python
import subprocess
subprocess.run(["command", "parameter1", "parameter2"])
```
### Step 3: Use an Allowlist 
Include only known good software in your User-Agent header. Regularly update the list of allowed user agents and block any agent not found on the list.

```python
ALLOWED_USER_AGENTS = ['known', 'good', 'agents']

def check_user_agent(user_agent):
    if user_agent not in ALLOWED_USER_AGENTS:
        # Reject the request or replace the User-Agent header
```
### Step 4: Escaping Special Characters
Special characters that are used in the construction of User-Agent headers should be escaped in order to prevent injection attacks. This can be achieved using several libraries that provide this functionality, like Apache's StringEscapeUtils in Java.

```java
import org.apache.commons.text.StringEscapeUtils;
 
String escapedString = StringEscapeUtils.escapeJava(userInput);
```
### Step 5: Least Privileges
The application running with the least privileges possible will limit what a command injection can do if it was successful.

For example, in Unix-based systems you could use this:
```bash
sudo -u leastprivilegeuser command
```
