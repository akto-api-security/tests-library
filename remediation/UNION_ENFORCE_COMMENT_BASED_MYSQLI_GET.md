## Remediation Steps for Union-based SQL Injection with Enforcing Comment Character Payloads for MySQL

Union-based SQL injection is a high-risk vulnerability that could allow an attacker to make the affected application process an arbitrary SQL SELECT query to the database using an UNION operator.

Below are the recommended steps to prevent Union-based SQL injection:

### Step 1: Use Prepared Statements (with Parameterized Queries)

The use of Prepared Statements with Parameterized Queries in your code is an effective way to prevent SQL injection. Databases handling the parameterized query separates the data from the command, which can prevent SQL injection.

#### PHP:
```php
$preparedStatement = $dbConnection->prepare('SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ?');
$preparedStatement->bind_param('s', $_GET['user_email']);
$preparedStatement->execute();
```

#### Python:
```python
from django.db import connection, transaction
cur = connection.cursor()
cur.execute("UPDATE bar SET foo = 1 WHERE baz = %s", [self.baz])
```

### Step 2: Use Stored Procedures

Stored procedures can provide a strong layer of security as it allows you to provide specific permissions, rather than granting all rights and permissions, to the database.

#### SQL:
```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE GetUserByEmail (@userEmail varchar(200))
AS
BEGIN
    SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Email = @userEmail;
END
```

### Step 3: Escaping All User-Supplied Input

This strategy involves accepting user input, and then escaping special characters using the specific escape syntax for that interpreter. This strategy is not optimal and should be used alongside other methods.

#### PHP:
```php
$user_email = mysql_real_escape_string($_GET['user_email']);
$query = sprintf("SELECT * FROM users WHERE email='%s'", $user_email);
```

### Step 4: Least Privilege Principle

Only provide the minimum privileges that are necessary for the particular database account. For instance, a database used by a user-facing application should not have the ability to drop databases.
