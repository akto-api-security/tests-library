## Remediation Steps for Sensitive Data Exposure (Mailchimp API Key)
Exposing sensitive data like the Mailchimp API key can potentially allow malicious entities to misuse the key, which may lead to unauthorized access or execution of operations associated with your Mailchimp account.

### Step 1: Remove API Key from Public Spaces
Ensure that the Mailchimp API key is not exposed in public spaces or repositories. This includes hardcoded in the source code that is publicly accessible. If the API key is discovered in such a space, regenerate it immediately.

### Step 2: Environment Variables
Store the Mailchimp API key in environment variables rather than keeping it directly in the source code. This ensures the key is not exposed in the version control system.

```python
import os
API_KEY = os.getenv('MAILCHIMP_API_KEY')
```

### Step 3: .env File (Don't forget to add .env to .gitignore)
For local development, you can store your sensitive data such as API keys in a .env file and fetch from there. Do not commit .env file to source control.

```bash
MAILCHIMP_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

To access the API key in your application:
```python
# Python Example
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()  # take environment variables from .env
API_KEY = os.getenv('MAILCHIMP_API_KEY')
```

### Step 4: Use Secret Manager Tools
In a production environment, consider the use of secret manager tools like AWS Secrets Manager, Vault, etc. These tools will keep your secret variables protected and also provide additional features like auto rotation of secrets.

```python
# Python AWS SDK (Boto3) example

import boto3

def get_secret():
    secret_name = "MAILCHIMP_API_KEY"
    region_name = "us-west-2"

    session = boto3.session.Session()
    client = session.client(
        service_name='secretsmanager',
        region_name=region_name
    )

    get_secret_value_response = client.get_secret_value(SecretId=secret_name)
    if 'SecretString' in get_secret_value_response:
        secret = get_secret_value_response['SecretString']
    else:
        secret = base64.b64decode(get_secret_value_response['SecretBinary'])
        
    return secret

API_KEY = get_secret()
```
