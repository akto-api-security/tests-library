# Remediation for SSRF_ON_XML_UPLOAD_AZURE_REDIRECT

## Remediation Steps for Sensitive Azure Details Exposure via SSRF (Server Side Request Forgery)
Exposing sensitive Azure details due to Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) is a severe security issue. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to Azure assets. 

### Step 1: Validate and Whitelist URLs
Review your application and identify all areas where user input is used to form URLs. Implement server-side input validation and sanitize these inputs. In Python for example, this could look like:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse

def validate_url(url):
    """
    Function to whitelist a set of URLs and validate a given URL against this whitelist
    """
    # Define a set of valid, safe URL endpoints
    whitelist = {"www.valid1.com", "www.valid2.com"}

    url_parsed = urlparse(url)
    
    # Make sure the URL is in the whitelist
    if url_parsed.netloc.lower() not in whitelist:
        raise Exception(f"Invalid URL: {url}. This URL is not part of the whitelist.")
```

### Step 2: Avoid Exposing Internal Resources
Ensure that your XML configuration files or any communication with Azure services do not expose sensitive data. Perform a thorough code review for this.

### Step 3: Implement a Firewall
If a specific service must make external calls, apply network egress filtering with a firewall. The firewall needs to deny outbound traffic to all known metadata endpoints.

For example, with IPtables (Linux) it could be:

```bash
sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -d metadata.google.internal -j DROP
sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -d 169.254.169.254 -j DROP
```
