# Remediation for SENSITIVE_DATA_EXPOSURE_AWS_ARN_CONNECT_INSTANCE

## Remediation Steps for Sensitive Data Exposure for AWS ARN CONNECT INSTANCE 

Sensitive data exposure, especially when involving AWS ARNs for Connect instances, may pose significant security threats. Therefore, it is crucial to strictly manage and control access to AWS Connect instance ARNs to ensure authorized usage and prevent potential threats.

### Step 1: Identifying Unused ARNs

Review and identify unused ARNs. These include ARNs connected with unused or redundant services.

```python
import boto3

def get_instances(region_name):
    session = boto3.Session(region_name)
    connect = session.client('connect')
    response = connect.list_instances()
    return response['InstanceSummaryList']
```

### Step 2: Managing Policies that Grant Permissions to Unnecessary ARNs

Remove or tighten IAM policies giving broad permissions. Update the policies to only have the required permissions for working ARNs and services.

```typescript
import * as iam from '@aws-cdk/aws-iam';

const policy = new iam.PolicyStatement({
  actions: ['connect:*'], 
  resources: ['arn:aws:connect:instanceIdentifier'], /*replace instanceIdentifier with the actual ARN of your instance*/
});

iamRole.addToPolicy(policy);
```

### Step 3: Regular Audit of ARNs

Conduct regular audits to continuously monitor the access and utilization of ARNs in your environment. One way to achieve this is through the use of AWS CloudTrail logs, which track every API call made to your AWS Environment.

```bash
aws cloudtrail lookup-events --lookup-attributes AttributeKey=ResourceName,AttributeValue=InstanceArn
```

### Step 4: Switch to Secure ARNs

Where possible, migrate to AWS Secure ARNs. Secure session manager eliminates the need to open inbound ports, handle SSH keys, and provides a secure and auditable means to access instances.

```bash
aws connect update-instance-attribute --instance-id InstanceId --attribute-type ATTRIBUTE --value SecureARN
```

Through these steps, sensitive data exposure related to AWS ARNs for Connect instances can be mitigated and minimized.
