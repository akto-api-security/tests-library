# Remediation for SOURCE_CODE_DISCLOSURE

## Remediation Steps for Source Code Disclosure
Source code disclosure is a serious security issue that could potentially leak sensitive system internals and configurations. This can provide attackers with valuable information that they can use to exploit the system.

### Step 1: Use .htaccess for Apache Server
If you're using an Apache server, you can add a `.htaccess` file in your root directory to prevent access to certain file types.
```Apache
<Files ~ "(.inc|\.php|\.phtml|\.php3|\.php4)$">
order allow,deny
deny from all
</Files>
```

### Step 2: Configuring Web.Config for IIS Server
If you're using Internet Information Services (IIS), you can configure your `web.config` file to disable access to certain extensions.
```XML
<system.webServer>
<security>
<requestFiltering>
<denyUrlSequences>
<add sequence=".inc" />
<add sequence=".cs" />
</requestFiltering>
</denyUrlSequences>
</security>
</system.webServer>
```

### Step 3: HTTP Headers
No matter what web server you are using, adding HTTP response headers to tell the browser not to cache the information can reduce the risk of source code disclosure.

`NO-SNIPPET` and `NOCACHE` HTTP headers could be used to instruct search engines and browsers respectively to not cache and store the webpage contents.

### Step 4: Regular Audit and Update
Regular patching and updating the system. Both the software of the server-side languages (like PHP, Java etc.) and the web server software (like Nginx, Apache etc.) should be kept up to date. Any known bugs that might cause source code disclosure would likely be patched in these updates.

### Step 5: Error Handling
Ensure that detailed error messages that might contain source code are not displayed to the users. This can be achieved by using custom error pages or by configuring the server to display generic error messages.

Remember, security is multifaceted and these steps alone will not guarantee your source code will not be disclosed. They should, however, significantly mitigate the risk. Regular audits and proper development practices are also important components of maintaining secure systems.
