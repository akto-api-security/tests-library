# Remediation for IMPROPER_ACCOUNT_TYPE_HANDLING

## Remediation Steps for Improper Account Type Handling for Downgrade

Improper handling of account types during downgrade is a security issue which may lead to unauthorized access or capabilities retained by a user. Here are some remediation steps to secure your system:

### Step 1: Invalidate Existing Sessions on Downgrade

Whenever an account is downgraded, ensure that you invalidate existing sessions. This will force the user to re-login under their new user type, preventing any holdover permissions from their previous type.

```python
from django.contrib.auth import logout

def downgrade_account(request):
    user = request.user
    user.account_type = 'basic'
    user.save()
    logout(request)
    return redirect('login')
```

### Step 2: Explicitly Set Permissions Based on User Type

When a user is downgraded, their permissions should be explicitly set according to their new user type. Permissions shouldn't just be removed to accommodate the downgrade, but rather set fresh to avoid any leftovers.

```Python
def downgrade_account(request):
    user = request.user
    user.account_type = 'basic'
    # Remove all the existing permissions
    user.user_permissions.clear()
    # Add permissions specific to the 'basic' user
    basic_permissions = Permission.objects.filter(codename__in=['can_view', 'can_edit'])
    user.user_permissions.set(basic_permissions)
    user.save()
    logout(request)
    return redirect('login')
```

### Step 3: Enhance Monitoring and Logging

Keep a close eye on system activity, logging any suspicious events such as multiple downgrades in a short time period or regular attempts to access higher privileges than the current user's account permits.

```python
import logging

def downgrade_account(request):
    #... rest of the code here
   
    logging.info('User {} downgraded to basic account.'.format(user.username))
    
    #... rest of the code here
```

### Step 4: Regular Audit and Update

Consider regular security audits and updates to your system to ensure any loophole is not exploited.

```bash
# Assuming an imaginary update and audit command
sudo update_and_audit_system
```
