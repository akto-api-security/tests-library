## Remediation Steps for Broken Authentication Test - Username Enumeration on Password Reset Endpoint

The issue of username enumeration on password reset endpoint can lead to broken authentication. This can potentially give an attacker the means to gain unauthorized access to user accounts. Here are the remediation steps to fix this vulnerability.

### Step 1: Implement a generic message for password reset
Return a generic message like "If your email is in our database, you will receive a password reset link." This prevents username enumeration as it doesn't disclose whether a specific user exists or not

```python
def password_reset(request):
    if request.method == 'POST':
        email = request.POST['email']
        if User.objects.filter(email=email).exists():
            # code to send password reset link
            message = "If your email is in our database, you will receive a password reset link."
            return render(request, 'password_reset.html', {'message': message})
```

### Step 2: Use non-sequential and non-guessable tokens for the reset link
This hardens the process against token guessing attacks.

```python
import secrets

def generate_password_reset_token():
    return secrets.token_urlsafe(20)
```

### Step 3: Implement rate limit of password reset requests
The number of password reset requests can be limited from a single IP or for a single user account to slow down or stop automated attacks.

```python
from django_ratelimit.decorators import ratelimit

@ratelimit(key='ip', rate='10/m') # 10 requests per minute
def password_reset(request):
    # rest of the method
    pass
```

### Step 4: Use case insensitive comparison for email addresses
To stop differentiating `user@example.com` and `USER@example.com`.

```python
email = request.POST['email'].lower()
if User.objects.filter(email=email).exists():
    # rest of the method
```
