# Remediation for BYPASS_DATE_BASED_ACCOUNT_RESTRICTIONS

## Remediation Steps for Bypass Date-based Account Restrictions

Bypassing date-based account restrictions is a serious security issue where users can access accounts beyond the permitted time frame. This can be prevented using proper validation and enforcement of date and time access restrictions. The below outlined steps use PHP as an example.

### Step 1: Database Field
A field should be added to the user database to set the allowed access periods for each user. This field needs to be updated upon account creation, changes, and all password resets.

For example, your SQL might look something like this:

```sql
ALTER TABLE users
ADD COLUMN valid_until TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;
```

### Step 2: Server-side Date Check

The server should be responsible for checking whether the current date is within the user's allowed access period. This is preferred over a client-side check because the client's system time can be modified by a malicious user.

```php
<?php
session_start();
if(isset($_SESSION['valid_until']) && time() > $_SESSION['valid_until']) {
  session_destroy();
  header('Location: /login.php'); // or wherever your login page is
}
```
### Step 3: Consistent Timing

Ensure that the system clock on all of your servers are synced to maintain consistency. NTP (Network Time Protocol) can be used for this purpose.

```bash
sudo apt-get install ntp
```

### Step 4: Regular Audit and Update

It's always a good practice to keep checking and updating the systems to keep up with the security standards. System audits need to be performed on a timely manner to enforce security.

```bash
sudo service apache2 restart
```

The outlined steps here are a guideline to help mitigate this issue, understand that security is a dynamic and continuous process that should adapt to the demands of your specific system or application.
