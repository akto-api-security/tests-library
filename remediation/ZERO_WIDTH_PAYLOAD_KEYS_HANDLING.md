## Remediation Steps for Zero Width Payload Keys Handling
The issue of Zero Width Payload Keys Handling vulnerability occurs when an attacker uses Zero Width Spaces (ZWSPs) to obfuscate harmful payloads. Some applications don't properly handle zero-width characters hidden in user inputs, causing undesired behaviors and potential security threats.
### Step 1: Input Validation
Create a centralized method of input validation where all inputs are sanitized before being processed. This includes checking for and removing zero-width characters.
In JavaScript, you can use the following function:
```javascript
function removeZWSPs(inputString) {
    // Zero Width Space is unicode character '\u200b'
    return inputString.replace(/\u200b/g, '');
}
```
### Step 2: Output Encoding
Ensure that all outputs to users are encoded in such a way that zero-width characters have no harmful effect. HTML Entities (`&#8203;`) should be used to replace these characters during output encoding.
### Step 3: Use of Security Headers
Make sure appropriate security headers (like `Content-Security-Policy`) are being used to mitigate possible Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
