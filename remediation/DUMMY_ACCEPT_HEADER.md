# Remediation for DUMMY_ACCEPT_HEADER

## Remediation Steps for Dummy Accept Header
A Dummy Accept Header security issue could arise when an application fails to validate or restricts the Accept request HTTP header to known media types. This can be exploited by attackers in multiple ways including causing the server to return unexpected data, causing errors in the application, or initiating attacks like content-type spoofing. 

### Step 1: Validate Accept Header
In any known language, such as Python, validation could be performed using the following:

```python
from flask import request, jsonify

@app.route('/api', methods=['GET'])
def get_data():
    accept_header = request.headers.get('Accept')
    valid_headers = ['application/json', 'application/xml']
    
    if accept_header not in valid_headers:
        return jsonify(error='Invalid Accept Header'), 406
    
    # Continue with the rest of your API logic
    ...
```
The condition checks whether the 'Accept' header received in the client's request is in the list of valid Headers (`valid_headers`).

### Step 2: Default Values
In some cases, you may want to set a default format if the incoming accept header is of a type you did not expect. Here's how you set the default to 'application/json':

```python
if accept_header not in valid_headers:
    accept_header = 'application/json'
```
