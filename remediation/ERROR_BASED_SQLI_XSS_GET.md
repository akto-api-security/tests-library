# Remediation for ERROR_BASED_SQLI_XSS_GET

## Remediation Steps for Error based SQL Injection Test with XSS for GET method APIs

SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities can have severe consequences if left unaddressed, potentially granting unauthorized access to sensitive data. 

### Step 1: Use Parameterized Queries or Prepared Statements

```java
// Prepared Statement in Java
String query = "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Username = ? AND Password = ?"; 
PreparedStatement pstmt = connection.prepareStatement(query);  
pstmt.setString(1, username);  
pstmt.setString(2, password); 
ResultSet rs = pstmt.executeQuery();
```

### Step 2: Employ Effective Input Validation 

Implement a strong policy for validating input on the server-side to ensure only expected input is processed in SQL queries. 

```java
// Java input validation example using regex. Adjust regex pattern to application's need
String input = getUserInput();
String pattern = "^[a-zA-Z0-9]*$"; // accepts only alphanumeric characters
if (input.matches(pattern)) {
    // proceed with SQL query
} else {
    // input invalid, return error or exception
}
```

### Step 3: Make-use of Web Application Firewall (WAF)

Web Application Firewalls are useful for filtering, monitoring and blocking HTTP traffic to and from a web application.

### Step 4: Utilize Proper Error Handling to Prevent Information Leakage

```java
try {
    // SQL related code
} catch (SQLException ex) {
    // Log stack trace for internal use and throw user-friendly message
    logger.log(Level.SEVERE, ex.getMessage(), ex);
    throw new Exception("An error occurred while trying to process your request.");
}
```

### Step 5: Update Content Security Policy (CSP)

This is an important measure to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. CSP defines which domains a browser should consider to be valid sources of executable scripts. 

```html
<!-- HTML Meta tag for CSP -->
<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="default-src 'self';">
```

### Step 6: Regular Auditing and Update

Regular audits to the security system and code base ensures no newer vulnerabilities have been introduced during the development process. Make sure to apply updates to dependencies that may include security patches.


Remember, Input should never be trusted implicitly and should always be properly validated and sanitized before being used in an SQL query or rendered in a web page.
