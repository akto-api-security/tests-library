## Remediation Steps for Unauthenticated Spark REST API Detection Test

Unauthorized access to an unauthenticated REST API for Apache Spark exposes a security risk. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary Spark jobs, read arbitrary local files accessible by the user running the REST API server, and possibly achieve remote code execution. 

### Step 1: Enable Authentication

Enable mutual, SSL-based authentication by setting the following configurations.

```scala
spark.ssl.enabled true
spark.ssl.keyPassword <key password>
spark.ssl.keyStore <keystore file>
spark.ssl.keyStorePassword <keystore password>
spark.ssl.protocol <protocol>
spark.ssl.standalone.enabled true
spark.ssl.ui.enabled true
```

Replace the above placeholders (`<key password>`, `<keystore file>`, etc.) with your actual details.

You should also secure the Spark master and worker by setting the following configurations:

```scala
spark.authenticate true
spark.authenticate.secret <your secret>
```

Replace `<your secret>` with a secret password of your choice.

### Step 2: Limit Network Access

Limit the network access to the machine by applying a firewall rule. For example:

```bash
sudo ufw deny from any to <machine IP> port <Spark REST API port>
sudo ufw allow from <trusted IP> to <machine IP> port <Spark REST API port>
```

Replace the placeholders `<machine IP>`, `<Spark REST API port>`, and `<trusted IP>` with your details.


### Step 3: Encrypted Data Transmission

Ensure that the data being transmitted is encrypted, especially when you are dealing with sensitive data. You can use SSL/TLS for this.

```scala
spark.network.crypto.enabled true
spark.network.crypto.saslEncryption.enabled true
```

By following the above instructions, you can make your Apache Spark installation much more secure against unauthorized access through the REST API.
