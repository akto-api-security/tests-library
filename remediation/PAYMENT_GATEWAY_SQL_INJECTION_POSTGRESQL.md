# Remediation for PAYMENT_GATEWAY_SQL_INJECTION_POSTGRESQL

## Remediation Steps for SQL Injection on Payment Gateway API for PostgreSQL
SQL Injection in Payment Gateway API is a critical security issue. If not properly dealt with, malicious actors could inject their own malicious SQL code into your queries, potentially stealing sensitive data or even altering your database.

### Step 1: Use Parameterized Queries or Prepared Statements
This type of query separates SQL commands from input data to make it impossible to inject malicious SQL commands. Here's an example in Python using psycopg2 library:

```python
import psycopg2

conn = psycopg2.connect("dbname=test user=postgres")
cur = conn.cursor()

# Never do this
# query = "SELECT * from users where email = " + user_input

# Do this
user_input = "user@example.com"
cur.execute("SELECT * from users where email = %s", (user_input,))

rows = cur.fetchall()

for row in rows:
    print(row)
```

### Step 2: Limit Privileges
Don't give your API permission to everything. Limit it only to what it needs to do. If, say, it only needs to execute SELECT queries, don't give it permission to delete or update.

### Step 3: Use a WAF (Web Application Firewall)
Web Application Firewalls can help detect and mitigate SQL Injection attacks by identifying malicious SQL queries.

### Step 4: Validate and Sanitize User Inputs
Ensure that data entered into your system is valid and safe. Don't blindly trust user input. Use sanitization and validation techniques to ensure the safety of your data.

```python
from django.core.exceptions import ValidationError

def validate_email(value):
    if '@' not in value:
        raise ValidationError('%s is not a valid email address' % value)

try:
    validate_email(user_input)
except ValidationError as e:
    print(e)
```
