# Remediation for OPEN_REDIRECT_HOST_HEADER_INJECTION

## Remediation Steps for Open Redirect Using Host Header Injection
Open redirect via host header injection is a significant security issue that could compromise your application's security. The attacker can use it for phishing attacks by redirecting to malicious sites or stealing confidential information from the user. 

### Step 1: Validate Incoming Headers

You can ensure that all incoming Host headers are validated against a whitelist of allowed hosts. 

For example, in Python Flask you could achieve this with: 

```python
from flask import Flask, request, abort
from flask import redirect

app = Flask(__name__)

ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['mywebsite.com', 'localhost'] 
# Update list as per your requirements

@app.before_request
def secure():
    host = request.headers.get('Host') 
    if host not in ALLOWED_HOSTS:
        abort(400, 'Invalid HOST header')

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return redirect(request.url)
```

### Step 2: Use Relative Redirects

If possible, use relative instead of absolute redirects to strip off the authority components added by the attacker.

```python
@app.route('/')
def index():
    return redirect('/target_url', code=302) 
# Example of relative redirect
```

### Step 3: Regular Auditing
Constantly monitor and audit your application for any security vulnerability. Update your host header validation mechanism if any changes are made in the application hosts.

### Step 4: Adoption of Content-Security-Policy (CSP)
Adopt CSP headers with proper settings. This will ensure that modern web browsers block any attempted redirect to an untrusted domain.

```python
# Example of adding CSP in Flask
@app.after_request
def apply_csp(response):
    response.headers['Content-Security-Policy'] = "default-src 'self'"
    return response
```
This way, even if your application is somehow vulnerable to host header injection, the browser would not allow for the redirect to unknown or untrusted hosts.
