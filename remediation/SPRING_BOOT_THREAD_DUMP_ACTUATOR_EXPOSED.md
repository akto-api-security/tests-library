# Remediation for SPRING_BOOT_THREAD_DUMP_ACTUATOR_EXPOSED

## Remediation Steps for Spring Boot Thread Dump Actuator Exposure
Spring Boot Actuator provides several built-in endpoints, including Thread Dump for debugging. If the thread dump actuator is exposed over an insecure network, it can lead to sensitive information disclosure. 

### Step 1: Disable Thread Dump Actuator
In the application.properties or application.yml file of your Spring Boot application, set the property management.endpoint.threaddump.enabled to false.

#### application.properties
```java
management.endpoint.threaddump.enabled=false
```
#### application.yml
```java
management:
  endpoint:
    threaddump:
      enabled: false
```

### Step 2: Enable Secure Access
If Thread Dump Actuator needs to be exposed, enable secure access. You may use Spring Security or any web security mechanism supported by your application. 

For example, here is a basic authentication configuration in Spring Security:

```java
@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

    @Autowired
    public void configureGlobal(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth) throws Exception {
        auth.inMemoryAuthentication()
            .withUser("user").password(passwordEncoder().encode("password")).roles("USER");
    }

    @Bean
    public PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder() {
        return new BCryptPasswordEncoder();
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Regular Audit and Update
Regularly update the Spring Boot and Spring Security dependencies to the latest stable versions for up-to-date security patches.

```bash
mvn versions:use-latest-versions
```
