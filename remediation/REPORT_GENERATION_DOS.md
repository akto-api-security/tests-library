# Remediation for REPORT_GENERATION_DOS

## Remediation Steps for Denial of Service Test on Report Generation Endpoint
Denial of Service (DoS) attacks can render report generation endpoints unresponsive or degrade services. A common pattern for preventing this is to implement rate limiting on the endpoint to prevent an attacker from overwhelming the server.

### Step 1: Implement Rate Limiting

You can implement rate limiting using a middleware in your server application. For example, on a NodeJS Express application, you can use the `express-rate-limit` library. Here's how you do that:

```javascript
const rateLimit = require("express-rate-limit");

// Enable rate limiting
const limiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 1 * 60 * 1000, // 1 minute
  max: 100 // limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
});

// Apply to report generation route
app.use("/report", limiter);
```

### Step 2: Validate Inputs

Always validate inputs to ensure that what is being passed doesn't cause unnecessary strain on the server.

```javascript
app.post('/report', (req, res) => {
  // validate input
  if (!isValidRequest(req)) {
    return res.status(400).send('Bad request');
  }
  // generate report here
});
```

### Step 3: Optimizing Database Queries

Optimize any database queries used in generating the report. Avoid using Queries that result in full table scans and try to optimize as much as possible.

```sql
-- Bad Query
SELECT * FROM report_data;

-- Better Query
SELECT column1, column2, column3
FROM report_data
WHERE condition;
```

### Step 4: Return only necessary data

Return only the data that is necessary for the generated report.

```javascript
app.get("/report", (req, res) => {
  // generate report
  const report = generateReport();
  // send only necessary data
  res.send(filterNecessaryData(report));
});
```
