## Remediation Steps for Denial of Service Test on GraphQL API having Variables Key with value Array of Special Characters

This particular security issue is related to a vulnerability where an attacker can potentially cause a Denial of Service (DoS) attack on a GraphQL API by widely manipulating the `Variables` key with an array of symbolic characters. To mitigate this issue, we must sanitize and limit the data inputs. 

Here are the steps to fix the vulnerability:

### Step 1: Input Validation 

We will be using a JavaScript example here because GraphQL is typically used with a Node.js server. We'll implement a custom scalar type in GraphQL Schema to validate if the input contains any special characters. 

```javascript
const { GraphQLScalarType } = require('graphql');

const NoSpecialChars = new GraphQLScalarType({
  name: 'NoSpecialChars',
  description: 'Strings without special characters',
  
  serialize(value) {
    return value.toString();
  },

  parseValue(value) {
    if (/[!@#$%^&*(),.?":{}|<>]/.test(value)) {
      throw new Error(`Special characters are not allowed in value: ${value}`);
    }
    return value;
  },
});

module.exports = NoSpecialChars;
```

### Step 2: Query Depth Limiting

Sometimes an attacker may send deeply nested queries that might cause the server to use an excessive amount of resources, potentially leading to a Denial of Service. To prevent this, we'll incorporate the `graphql-depth-limit` package for limiting deep queries.

```bash
npm install graphql-depth-limit
```

Then, use it in your GraphQL server:

```javascript
const depthLimit = require('graphql-depth-limit');
const express = require('express');
const expressGraphQL = require('express-graphql'); 

const app = express();

app.use('/graphql', expressGraphQL(request => ({
  schema: MyGraphQLSchema,
  validationRules: [ depthLimit(10) ],
})));

app.listen(4000);
```
