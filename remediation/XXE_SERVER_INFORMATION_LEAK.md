# Remediation for XXE_SERVER_INFORMATION_LEAK

## Remediation Steps for XML External Entity (XXE) Test for Server Information Leak
XML External Entity (XXE) is an severe security issue. XXE attacks exploit a property of XML parsers to allow attackers to interfere with the application's processing of XML data, causing disclosure of internal files, denial of service, server side request forgery, port scanning from the device hosting the parser, and other system impacts.

### Step 1: Disable Document Type Definitions (DTDs)
Many XXE issues can be avoided by completely disabling DTDs from XML applications, which is where the vulnerability typically originates.

```java
DocumentBuilderFactory dbf = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();
dbf.setFeature("http://apache.org/xml/features/disallow-doctype-decl", true);
```

### Step 2: Disable External Entities
If DTDs can't be completely disabled, then applications should at least disable external entities in the XML parser.

```java
dbf.setFeature("http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities", false);
dbf.setFeature("http://xml.org/sax/features/external-parameter-entities", false);
dbf.setFeature("http://apache.org/xml/features/nonvalidating/load-external-dtd", false);
```

### Step 3: Use Less Complex Data Formats
Whenever possible, consider using less complex data formats such as JSON, and avoiding serialization of sensitive data. If XML must be used, ensure any and all XML or XSL file processing is safe against XXE attacks.

Remember, policing XML is tough - especially in legacy systems. It's better to avoid the risk altogether if possible.

### Step 4: Regular Auditing and Update
Work closely with your security team to conduct regular audits on your code and keep the system updated to protect against the latest known vulnerabilities. 

Please note: The provided source code is in Java. For other programming languages, the exact steps or code might differ but the main strategy of disabling DTDs and external entities remains the same.
