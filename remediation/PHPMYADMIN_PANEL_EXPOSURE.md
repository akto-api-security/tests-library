# Remediation for PHPMYADMIN_PANEL_EXPOSURE

## Remediation Steps for phpMyAdmin Panel Exposure
PhpMyAdmin Panel Exposure is a critical security issue as it exposes your database to the possibilities of unauthorized access and manipulations. Below are the recommended remediation steps to secure your phpMyAdmin panel:

### Step 1: Enable Authentication
The simplest way of securing the phpMyAdmin Panel is to enable authentication. It can be done by setting the `auth_type` to `cookie` or `http` in the phpMyAdmin configuration file.

```php
$cfg['Servers'][$i]['auth_type'] = 'cookie';
```
or
```php
$cfg['Servers'][$i]['auth_type'] = 'http';
```

### Step 2: Allow Access Only From Specific IP
You can restrict the access to phpMyAdmin only from specific IP addresses. This can be done by updating the Apache configuration file.

```apache
<Directory /usr/share/phpMyAdmin/>
   Order Deny,Allow
   Deny from All
   Allow from 192.0.2.0/24
</Directory>
```
Replace `192.0.2.0/24` with your specific IP address or range.

### Step 3: Setup HTTPS
Setting up HTTPS to serve phpMyAdmin can prevent eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks. This can be accomplished by installing an SSL Certificate and configuring the Apache to use it. The following is an example of how you can configure Apache:

```apache
<VirtualHost *:443>
   ServerName your-domain.com
   DocumentRoot /var/www/html/phpMyAdmin

   SSLEngine on
   SSLCertificateFile /etc/ssl/certs/ssl-cert-snakeoil.pem
   SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/ssl/private/ssl-cert-snakeoil.key

   <Directory /usr/share/phpMyAdmin/>
      Require ip 192.0.2.0/24
   </Directory>

   ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
   CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
</VirtualHost>
```
