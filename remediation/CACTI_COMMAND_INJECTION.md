# Remediation for CACTI_COMMAND_INJECTION

## Remediation Steps for Cacti Command Injection Test

Cacti command injection vulnerability can lead to remote code execution if an attacker is able to inject a command through Cacti. It is critical to ensure that your Cacti setup is secure against such security risks.

### Step 1: Update Cacti to the latest version
The most effective way to mitigate the risk of Cacti command injection is to use the latest version of Cacti, which includes patches for all known vulnerabilities.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade cacti
```
Note: Replace `apt` with your distribution's package manager (e.g., `yum` for CentOS, `zypper` for SUSE)

### Step 2: Sanitize User Input
Ensure all user inputs are properly sanitized prior to being processed by Cacti. Avoid using user input directly in system or shell commands without sanitization.

For instance, consider using prepared statements or parameterized queries in SQL. Here is an example using PHP that avoids the Cacti vulnerability:

```php
$query = $pdo->prepare("SELECT * FROM systems WHERE id = :id");
$query->execute(array(":id" => $input));
```

### Step 3: Use Least Privilege Principle
Configure Cacti and its underlying database to run with the least privilege necessary. This step reduces the potential harm that can result from a command injection vulnerability in Cacti.

For instance, if you're running Cacti with a MySQL database, avoid using the MySQL `root` user for Cacti. Instead, create a dedicated MySQL user that has only the necessary permissions:

```bash
mysql -uroot -p
```
```mysql
CREATE USER 'cacti'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'your_password_here';
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON cacti.* TO 'cacti'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```
### Step 4: Regularly Check and Update
Conduct regular audits to spot vulnerabilities as and when they arrive. Always keep your installation up-to-date with the latest security patches and updates from Cacti.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade cacti
```
