# Remediation for LLM_GLITCH_2

## Remediation Steps for Overreliance on LLMs - Glitch Test with InstoreAndOnline

One of the most common security issues is over-reliance on Lower Level Manager( LLMs) and Glitch Test for InstoreAndOnline feature. Hackers could exploit these vulnerabilities, resulting in a serious security breach. Follow the steps below to remediate the issue.

### Step 1: Verify LLM Configurations

The first step is to verify your configurations and dependencies. Detect if there's a misconfiguration that may cause a security loophole.

```bash
# Assuming a Linux distribution, check your LLM service status
sudo systemctl status {your-LLM-service}
```

### Step 2: Add Security Layers for LLMs

Adding extra security layers between the consumer and LLM could reduce potential risks. This could be achieved using encryption and secure communication protocols.

```java
// Assuming you are using Java, implement SSL communication for your LLM
SSLServerSocketFactory ssf = (SSLServerSocketFactory) SSLServerSocketFactory.getDefault();
ServerSocket ss = ssf.createServerSocket(port);
```

### Step 3: Conduct Glitch Test Regularly

Conducting glitch tests regularly will help you identify vulnerabilities timely, taking proactive measures to patch security issues.

```bash
# Start a glitch test script for your instoreAndOnline feature
python glitch_test.py instoreAndOnline
```

### Step 4: Adopt Rate Limiting

By implementing rate limiting, you can prevent attackers from flooding your LLMs, which can lead to a system crash.

```python
# An example of using Python package 'ratelim' to limit the invocation
import ratelim

@ratelim.greedy(10, per=60)  # This limits the LLM request to 10 per minute
def api_call():
  # Your LLM API call here
  pass
```
