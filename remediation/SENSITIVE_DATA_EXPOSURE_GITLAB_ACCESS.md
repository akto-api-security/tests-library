# Remediation for SENSITIVE_DATA_EXPOSURE_GITLAB_ACCESS

## Remediation Steps for GitLab Sensitive Data Exposure

Sensitive data exposure via GitLab access is a serious security issue. If an attacker gains unauthorized access, they might compromise your system and data. Here is a step-by-step guide to address this vulnerability.

### Step 1: Configure Access Control

Strengthen user authorization and authentication to restrict unauthorized access.

```ruby
# config/initializers/rack_attack.rb

class Rack::Attack
  Rack::Attack.blocklist('block 2 bad requests per minute') do |req|
    Rack::Attack::Allow2Ban.filter(req.ip, maxretry: 2, findtime: 1.minutes) do
      req.path.include?('/users/sign_in') && req.post?
    end
  end
end
```
This Ruby on Rails script will limit login attempts to 2 per minute, which will reduce chances of brute force attacks.

### Step 2: Encrypt Confidential Data

All sensitive data should be encrypted, both at-rest and in-transit.

If using Rails, `attr_encrypted` gem helps to encrypt and decrypt attributes seamlessly.

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  attr_encrypted :ssn, key: 'A secret key'
end
```

### Step 3: Regularly Update GitLab

Keep your GitLab instance up-to-date. Regular updates will often include security patches and fixes.

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade gitlab-ee
```

### Step 4: Regularly Audit and Update

Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify potential vulnerabilities and fix them. 

Remember, security is not a one-time effort but a continuous process.

### Step 5: Use Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

Enabling 2FA adds an additional layer of security for your account, making it more difficult for an attacker even if they have access to the user's password.

```bash
# .gitlab-ci.yml

two_factor:
  script: gitlab-rails console -e production -c 'User.find_by(username: "USER_NAME").enable_two_factor!("#{OTP_CODE}")'
```

Note: Replace 'USER_NAME' with the username to be updated, and replace 'OTP_CODE' with the one-time-password for the 2FA.
