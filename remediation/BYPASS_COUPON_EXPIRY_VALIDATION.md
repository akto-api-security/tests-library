## Remediation Steps for Bypass Coupon Expiry Validation
Bypass coupon expiry validation can potentially allow expired coupons to be used, causing possible loss of revenues. This issue arises due to faulty validations or lack of proper security checks before applying a coupon.

### Step 1: Validate on the Server-Side
Server-side validation is mandatory since client-side can be easily bypassed. Never rely solely on client-side validation because it can be potentially tampered with or entirely turned off. Here is an example of how to do it in Python with Django:

```python
from django.core.exceptions import ValidationError
from datetime import datetime

def validate_coupon(coupon):
    if coupon.expiry_date < datetime.now():
        raise ValidationError('This coupon has expired.')
```
### Step 2: Double Check the Validation on the Client-Side
While server-side validation is the most secure, you can improve the user experience by also validating dates on the client-side. This is done primarily with JavaScript:

```javascript
function validateCoupon(coupon) {
    let currentDate = new Date();
    let expiryDate = new Date(coupon.expiryDate);

    if (expiryDate < currentDate) {
        alert('This coupon has expired.');
        return false;
    }
    return true;
}
```
### Step 3: Store Coupon Expiry Dates in the Database
Store coupon expiry dates in a field in the database so they cannot be manipulated by the client.

```SQL
CREATE TABLE Coupons(
      ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
      Code VARCHAR(20),
      ExpiryDate DATE
);
```
