# Remediation for COMMAND_INJECTION_DNS_EXFILTRATION_CHAINED

## Remediation Steps for Command Injection in DNS Exfiltration

Command injection in DNS Exfiltration occurs when an attacker gains control over the system commands that a web application uses within HTTP request parameters. This allows the attacker to chain system instructions and exfiltrate important data using DNS. Here are the steps to remediate this security issues.

### Step 1: Sanitize All Inputs
Ensure all inputs are properly sanitized to avoid injection attacks. Regular expressions should be used to validate any input in any known language, such as Python:

```python
import re

def sanitize_input(input):
    return re.sub(r'[^a-zA-Z0-9]', '', input)
```

### Step 2: Use a Safe API
Use APIs that avoid the use of the interpreter entirely or provide a safe interface. For example, in Python, you can use subprocess.run().

```python
import subprocess

def safe_command_run(command):
    subprocess.run(command, shell=False)
```
### Step 3: Limit Permissions
Limit the permissions of the application to restrict the functionality that can be exploited by Command Injection. For UNIX-based systems, this might look like:

```bash
chmod o-x /path/to/important/files
```

### Step 4: Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF)
A WAF can help to detect and mitigate command injection attacks. The configuration might vary based on the firewall, hence consult the corresponding documentation.
