# Remediation for IDENTIFY_PUBLIC_ACCESS_API

## Remediation Steps for Improper Inventory Management - Publicly Accessible APIs 

Exposing APIs in a private environment can greatly increase the risk of a serious security breach, potentially allowing unauthorized individuals to gain access to sensitive data. 

### Step 1: Identify and Document All APIs
Start by carrying out a comprehensive audit of all APIs used within your private environment. This could be done manually, through code analysis tools, or even using API discovery services.
```python
# Use code analysis tools to discover APIs in your environment
# Replace 'your_code_directory' with the path to your code

import os
import re

def find_apis(directory):
    for root, dirs, files in os.walk(directory):
        for file in files:
            if file.endswith('.py'):
                with open(os.path.join(root, file), 'r') as f:
                    contents = f.read()
                    if 'api' in contents:
                        print(f"API found in: {os.path.join(root, file)}")

find_apis('your_code_directory')
```

### Step 2: Restrict Access to the APIs
Make modifications to the code where necessary to restrict public access to the APIs identified in step 1. You can do that by setting up API Gateway Authorization for the APIs.

```javascript
// Using serverless framework with AWS API Gateway
module.exports = {
  service: 'private-apis',
  provider: {
    name: 'aws',
    runtime: 'nodejs12.x',
    region: 'us-east-1'
  },
  functions: {
    privateFunction: {
      handler: 'handler.privateFunction',
      events: [
        {
          http: {
            path: 'private-endpoint',
            method: 'post',
            cors: true,
            authorizer: 'aws_iam'
          }
        },
      ],
    },
  },
};
```

### Step 3: Monitor and Audit API Usage
Continue to monitor and audit API usage going forward, ensuring all are used properly and none are exposing unnecessary information.

```bash
# Use AWS CloudTrail for API Call monitoring
aws cloudtrail create-trail --name MyTrail
aws cloudtrail start-logging --name MyTrail
```
