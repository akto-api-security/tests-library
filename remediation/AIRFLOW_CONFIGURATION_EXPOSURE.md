## Remediation Steps for Apache Airflow Configuration Exposure
Apache Airflow configuration exposure can lead to serious security issues. It can provide unauthorized users with sensitive information, potentially leading to broader system access. To mitigate this issue, we need to configure Airflow correctly. 

### Step 1: Run Airflow Webserver in a Secure Environment
Airflow webserver should be run in an environment that is only accessible by trusted entities. We can accomplish this using a reverse proxy. For example, in Nginx:

```nginx
location / {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
}
```

### Step 2: Enable RBAC 
Enable Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Airflow. Starting from Airflow 1.10, the web server comes with RBAC and it is highly advisable to enable it.

To do this, update the settings in the `airflow.cfg`:

```python
[webserver]
rbac = True
```

### Step 3: Use Password Protection
Both RBAC and Flask-AppBuilder support using OAuth and LDAP. You should use this to protect your Airflow installation. This can also be specified in `airflow.cfg`.

```python
[webserver]
authenticate = True
auth_backend = airflow.contrib.auth.backends.password_auth
```

### Step 4: Hide sensitive Variable Fields
Airflow Variables have an option to be “Hidden”. This means their values will be hidden in the UI. These should be set to `True` for sensitive information.

```python
airflow variables -s 'my_hidden_variable' 'my_value' --hide
```
