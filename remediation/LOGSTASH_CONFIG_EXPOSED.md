# Remediation for LOGSTASH_CONFIG_EXPOSED

## Remediation Steps for Logstash Config Files Exposure
Exposing Logstash configuration files is a serious issue as it can provide attackers unauthorized access to sensitive data. Here are some steps you can follow to mitigate this vulnerability.

### Step 1: Configure File Permissions
Limiting access to your Logstash config files is crucial. Change the file permissions so that only the user running Logstash has manage access to this file. 
```bash
chmod 600 /path/to/logstash.conf
chown logstash:logstash /path/to/logstash.conf
```

### Step 2: Use Firewalls
Set up a firewall to prevent unauthorized external access to the directory containing your Logstash configuration files.
```bash
sudo ufw deny from any to /path/to/logstash.conf
```

### Step 3: Encrypt Sensitive Data
Add an extra layer of security by encrypting any sensitive data in your Logstash configuration files, such as usernames and passwords.
```bash
# pseudocode
def encrypt_data(data):
    # implement encryption logic here
    return encrypted_data

encrypted_password = encrypt_data('my_password')
```

### Step 4: Regularly Update and Audit
Ensure that you frequently update and audit your security settings.
```bash
# make sure logstash is updated regularly
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade logstash
```
Remember the principle of least privilege when granting access to your Logstash configuration files. Only give access to those who absolutely need it.
