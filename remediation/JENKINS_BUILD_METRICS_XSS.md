## Remediation Steps for Jenkins build-metrics Cross-Site Scripting 

Jenkins build-metrics cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability is usually found when user-supplied data is not appropriately validated and sanitized in a web application. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious scripts to trick users into performing actions they do not intend to.

### Step 1: Update affected Build-Metrics Plugin
The best way to mitigate this security vulnerability is by updating your Jenkins Build-Metrics Plugin to the latest version. The Jenkins team usually releases updates to their plugins to solve any discovered security issues.
```bash
# Go to Managed Jenkins -> Manage plugins -> Updates Available and find the Build-Metrics Plugin
# Click 'Download now and install after restart' 
```
### Step 2: Data Validation and Sanitization 
Avoid blindly trusting user input, validate and sanitize all user inputs. Make use of available Jenkins features or libraries in your chosen programming language to ensure input validation and sanitization.
```java
// Java Validation Example
Validator validator = Validation.buildDefaultValidatorFactory().getValidator();
Set<ConstraintViolation<YourClass>> violations = validator.validate(yourInstance);
if (!violations.isEmpty()) {
  // Handle validation errors
}
```
### Step 3: Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)
Implementing a Content Security Policy adds an additional layer of protection against cross-site scripting attacks. CSP restricts where resources can be loaded from, making it harder for an attacker to inject malicious content.
To set a Content Security Policy header, navigate to Jenkins -> Managed Jenkins -> Script Console
```groovy
System.setProperty("hudson.model.DirectoryBrowserSupport.CSP", "sandbox; default-src 'self';")
```
