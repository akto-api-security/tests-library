## Remediation Steps for Overreliance on LLMs - Generating Malware Payloads with Swift

Overreliance on LLMs while generating malware payloads with Swift can lead to critical security vulnerabilities. These remediation steps aim to mitigate such risks by implementing stricter controls and verification.

### Step 1: Reinforce Input Validation 

Ensure safe and strict input validation is enforced. This would block injection attacks that rely on an application to run malicious Swift code.

```swift
func validateInput(input: String) -> Bool {
let specialCharacters = "!@#$%^&*"
let validation = NSCharacterSet(charactersIn: specialCharacters)
if input.rangeOfCharacter(from: validation) == nil {
    return true
} else {
    return false
}
}
```

### Step 2: Implement LLMs Safely

Refrain from overreliance on Lower-Level Languages (LLMs). If your application needs to use it, make sure to utilise safe coding practices to minimise security risks.

```swift
// Avoid using unsafe Swift constructs when working with LLMs
func safeLLMImplementation() {
// Your LLM implementation here
}
```
