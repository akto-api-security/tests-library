# Remediation for SENSITIVE_DATA_EXPOSURE_SALESFORCE_DOMAIN

## Remediation Steps for Sensitive Data Exposure in Salesforce Domain  

Sensitive data exposure in Salesforce Domain is a critical security concern. Without proper countermeasures, attackers can gain unauthorized access to sensitive data and can bring significant harm to the business.

### Step 1: Use Secure Communications

Ensure all Salesforce API communications are secure using HTTPS/TLS.

### Step 2: Enforce IP Range restrictions

Limit API access to trusted IP ranges. This can be done in Salesforce by going to Setup -> Network Access -> New IP range.

### Step 3: Use Field-Level Security

Field-Level Security (FLS) can be used to restrict access to specific sensitive fields for certain profiles.

Here is a sample code on how to check for FLS:

```java
public Boolean isAccessible(String fieldName) {
    return Schema.sObjectType.Object__c.fields.getMap().get(fieldName).getDescribe().isAccessible();
}
```
### Step 4: Encrypt Sensitive Data

Using Salesforce Shield or Platform Encryption to encrypt sensitive data at rest.

### Step 5: Regular Audit and Update

Regularly review and update your security configuration and perform security health checks.

Remember, always apply the principle of least privilege. Only give the necessary access rights to users who need it to perform their job.
