# Remediation for LLM_MALWARE_SUBFUNCTION_SWIFT

## Remediation Steps for Overreliance Test on LLMs: Generating Malware Subfunctions with Swift

Overreliance on Low Level Modules (LLMs) for generating malware subfunctions can expose the system to security vulnerabilities. This is because LLMs provide an easy point of access for hackers. Here are the steps to remediate:

### Step 1: Use High Level Modules (HLMs) or Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
Avoid using LLMs for generating malware subfunctions and instead, use High-Level Modules (HLMs) which are much more secure due to their high levels of abstraction. You can also use an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) methods.

```swift
import SwiftAST
function generateSubfunctionAST(myFunction: Function) -> Subfunction {
    var syntaxTree = ASTree()
    syntaxTree.parse(myFunction)
    return syntaxTree.generateSubfunction()
}
```

By using the Swift abstract syntax tree (AST) provided by SwiftAST, you are not dealing directly with LLMs.
