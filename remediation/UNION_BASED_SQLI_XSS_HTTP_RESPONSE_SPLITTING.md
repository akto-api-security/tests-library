# Remediation for UNION_BASED_SQLI_XSS_HTTP_RESPONSE_SPLITTING

## Remediation Steps for Union based SQL Injection Test with XSS and HTTP Response Splitting

This issue involves several cross-cutting concerns, each requiring a different mitigation strategy. 

### Step 1: Mitigate SQL Injection
For the SQL Injection vulnerability, parameterized queries or prepared statements should be used. This way, the structure of the SQL query is fixed and no attacker can change it, as the input is only valid data and not part of the query. Here is an example in Python, using the `psycopg2` library to interact with a PostgreSQL database:

```python
import psycopg2

# Connect to the database
conn = psycopg2.connect(database="mydb", user="myuser", password="mypassword")

# Open cursor to perform database operations
cur = conn.cursor()

# Prepared statement
cur.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = %s AND password = %s", (username, hashed_password))
```

### Step 2: Mitigate XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)
To prevent XSS attacks, make sure to sanitize user inputs and encode data output. For example, in a JavaScript-based web application, you can use encoding methods provided by JavaScript:

```javascript
let safeOutput = document.createTextNode(userInput);
document.body.appendChild(safeOutput);
```

### Step 3: Mitigate HTTP Response Splitting
For mitigating HTTP response splitting, ensure that users' inputs are not directly passed into header fields. In case you must include user inputs in the headers, apply encoding where newline characters get replaced with their encoded equivalents. An example in Python to encode `\n` and `\r` can look as follows:

```python
import urllib.parse

user_input = urllib.parse.quote(user_input, safe='')
```
