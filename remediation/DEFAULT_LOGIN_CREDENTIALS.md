## Remediation Steps for Default Login Credentials
Default login credentials are a major security risk. If not changed, attackers can use these default credentials to gain unauthorized access to systems, applications, or services.

### Step 1: Change Default Administrator Password
Upon initial setup of any system, application, or software, always modify the default login credentials. Here is a general example of password change in Linux.

```bash
passwd username
```

Replace 'username' with your actual username. You will be prompted to enter the new password twice for confirmation.

### Step 2: Make Passwords Strong and Unique
Ensure that the new passwords you set are strong and unique to reduce the likelihood of brute-force attacks. A strong password is typically more than 8 characters long, includes a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols.  

### Step 3: Remove or Disable Unnecessary Default Accounts
Some systems or applications may come with default accounts that are unnecessary. You should disable or remove these accounts if they're not needed.

```bash
sudo userdel -r username
```

Replace 'username' with the name of the unnecessary account.

### Step 4: Use Authentication Solutions
Implement authentication solutions such as two-factor authentication (2FA) or multi-factor authentication (MFA) to add an extra layer of security.

There are many libraries which can help in implementing 2FA like PyOTP for python:

```python
from pyotp import totp
totp = pyotp.TOTP('base32secret3232')
print("Current OTP:", totp.now())
```
