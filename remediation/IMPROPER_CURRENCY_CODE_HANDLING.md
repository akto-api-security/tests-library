# Remediation for IMPROPER_CURRENCY_CODE_HANDLING

## Remediation Steps for Improper Currency Code Handling

Improper currency code handling can lead to inaccurate financial calculations or even allow malicious actors to manipulate transactions. Care must be taken to handle currency codes in a secure and standardized manner.

### Step 1: Install a Currency Code Library

There are many libraries available in different programming languages that handle currency codes properly. Install one that is suitable for your programming language. 

For instance, in Ruby, you can use the `money` gem:

```bash
gem install money
```

### Step 2: Use Standard Currency Codes

Always use ISO 4217 standard currency codes in your application. Most libraries support these standard codes out of the box.

In Ruby:

```ruby
money = Money.new(1000, "USD")
puts money.currency
```

### Step 3: Implement Validation

Ensure all user-provided currency codes are validated before use in computations or database storage. This can often be achieved using functionality provided by the currency code library.

In Ruby:

```ruby
begin
  # Attempt to instantiate a Money object with user provided currency
  money = Money.new(1, params[:currency])
rescue Money::Currency::UnknownCurrency
  # The currency provided by the user was not recognized
  puts "Invalid currency code provided"
end
```
