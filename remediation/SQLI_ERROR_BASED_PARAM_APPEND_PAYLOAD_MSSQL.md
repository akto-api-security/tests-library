## Remediation Steps for Error Based SQL Injection

Error Based SQL Injection is a type of SQL Injection attack that relies on error messages thrown by the database server to obtain information about the structure of the database. This type of attack can be harmful as it allows attackers to exploit poorly constructed SQL query logic in a web application and gain unauthorized access to data.

### Step 1: Prepare the Database
One way to prevent SQL injection is to use parameterized SQL queries, which separates the SQL logic from the data being supplied.

```C#
string sql = "SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE CustomerId = @Id";
SqlCommand command = new SqlCommand(sql, connection);
command.Parameters.Add(new SqlParameter("@Id", CustomerID));
```
Parameters are placeholders for user-supplied values, thereby preventing the SQL logic from being manipulated by unexpected input.

### Step 2: Use an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) Tool
Using an ORM tool like Entity Framework can help to reduce the risk of SQL Injection as it uses parameterized queries automatically.

```C#
using (var context = new MyContext())
{
    var customer = context.Customers
        .SingleOrDefault(c => c.CustomerId == CustomerID);
}
```
In the example above, the 'CustomerId' is automatically parameterized, which prevents any attempt at SQL Injection.

### Step 3: Implementing a Web Application Firewall (WAF)
A WAF can help protect your web application by monitoring HTTP traffic and blocking suspicious patterns that may suggest an SQL injection attempt.
