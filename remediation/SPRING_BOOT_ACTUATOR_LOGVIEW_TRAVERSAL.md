# Remediation for SPRING_BOOT_ACTUATOR_LOGVIEW_TRAVERSAL

## Remediation Steps for Spring Boot Actuator Logview Directory Traversal

Spring Boot Actuator Logview Directory Traversal issue can lead to unauthorized access to private data. Traversal allows an attacker to access files and directories that lie outside the web root directory.

### Step 1: Update Spring Boot Actuator Logview
Ensure you are using the latest version of Spring Boot Actuator Logview. Fixes for security issues are often provided in updates, hence the latest version should be less vulnerable.
```bash
mvn clean install
mvn versions:use-latest-versions
```
### Step 2: Validate User Inputs
Ensure to validate, filter and sanitize all user inputs or any data from untrusted source before handling.

```java
String input = request.getParameter("input");
if (!isValid(input)) {
   throw new IllegalArgumentException();
}
```

### Step 3: Enforce Least Privilege
Limit the privileges of the Spring Boot application. It should only have the permissions necessary to perform its tasks.

### Step 4: Enable Security with Spring Security
Spring Security ensures that only authenticated users can access the actuator endpoints by default.
```java
@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
public class WebSecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http.authorizeRequests().anyRequest().authenticated()
            .and().httpBasic()
            .and().csrf().disable();
    }
}
```
### Step 5: Restrict Access to Actuator Endpoints
You can restrict access to the actuator endpoints to only internal services.
```java
management:
  endpoints:
    web:
      exposure:
        include: health, info
  endpoint:
    health:
      show-details: always
```
