## Remediation Steps for Dummy Content-Type Header

Dummy Content-Type header vulnerability arises when a website doesn't properly validate the `Content-Type` header for a request, leaving it vulnerable to various attacks like XSS (Cross Site Scripting), SQL Injection and more.

### Step 1: Validate Content-Type Header
Always validate the `Content-Type` of every request made to your server. User input should never be trusted blindly. Below is an example of how to do this in JavaScript using Express.js:

```javascript
app.use((req, res, next) => {
    const validContentTypes = ['application/json', 'multipart/form-data'];
    if (!validContentTypes.includes(req.headers['content-type'])) {
        return res.status(400).send('Invalid Content-Type');
    }
    next();
});
```

### Step 2: Sanitize User Input
In addition to validating headers, always sanitize user inputs. This helps to prevent other types of injection attacks which could be possible if an attacker manages to bypass your `Content-Type` header checking mechanism.
Below is an example of how to do this in Python using Django:

```python
from django.utils.html import escape

def handle_input(user_input):
    safe_input = escape(user_input)
    # process the safe_input as required
```


### Step 3: Use Security Headers
Finally, use appropriate security headers (like `Content-Security-Policy`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, etc.) to prevent various attacks. Below is an example in Node.js Express application:

```javascript
var helmet = require('helmet');

app.use(helmet());
```
