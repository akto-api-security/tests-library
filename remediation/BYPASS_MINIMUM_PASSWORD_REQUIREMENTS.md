# Remediation for BYPASS_MINIMUM_PASSWORD_REQUIREMENTS

## Remediation Steps for Bypass Minimum Password Requirements

Bypassing minimum password requirements is a critical security issue. If not properly enforced, attackers may be able to set weak passwords and gain unauthorized access to an account. The following steps provide instructions on how to enforce minimum password requirements in code using **Python**.

### Step 1: Defining a Strong Password Logic
A strong password should include a certain minimum length, numbers, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and special characters. Here is a Python function that checks all these conditions:

```python
import re

def validate_password(password): 
    min_len = 8
    if len(password) < min_len:
        return False
    elif re.search('[0-9]',password) is None:
        return False
    elif re.search('[A-Z]',password) is None: 
        return False
    elif re.search('[a-z]',password) is None: 
        return False
    elif re.search('[!@#$%^&*(),.?":{}|<>]',password) is None: 
        return False
    else: 
        return True
        
```

### Step 2: Implement Password Validation Logic while User Registration/Password Change 

Call the function `validate_password` whenever a new user registers or an existing user changes their password. 

```python
def user_registration(username, password):
    # Check password strength
    if not validate_password(password):
        return "Password does not meet minimum requirements"
        
    # Continue with the rest of the registration process...
    
def user_change_password(username, old_password, new_password):
    # Verify old password, then:
    if not validate_password(new_password):
        return "Password does not meet minimum requirements"
        
    # Continue with the change password process...
```

Remember, adequate notifications should be provided to the users about the minimum password requirements at the time of registration/password change. 

### Step 3: Regular Audit and Update 

Regularly check and update the password rules as per the latest security standards and practices. Always evaluate whether the current minimum password requirements are strong enough to safeguard your users' accounts. 

In addition, encourage users to regularly update their passwords and not to reuse old ones. Similarly, you may want to implement a way to enforce password changes every certain period of time, e.g., every 60 or 90 days.
