# Remediation for MANIPULATE_AUTO_RENEWAL

## Remediation Steps for Manipulate Auto Renewal in Subscriptions

An attacker manipulating auto-renewal in subscriptions can lead to unpaid services being automatically renewed, leading to unplanned costs or even service disruptions if the service continues without successful payment. Here is how to ensure auto-renewal manipulation is prevented.

### Step 1: Implement Strong Authentication

Use strong authentication methods like multi-factor authentication (MFA) to ensure the user interacting with the site is genuine before the auto-renewal changes are approved. 

Example with Python Flask:
```python
from flask import Flask, request
from flask_mfa import MFA

app = Flask(__name__)
mfa = MFA(app)

@app.route('/settings',methods=['POST'])
def settings():
    if mfa.verify_token(request.form['mfa_token']):
        # User has passed MFA, safe to let them alter subscription settings
        # ...
```

### Step 2: Use Encryption

Encrypt sensitive details such as payment information, subscription details using encryption algorithms. 
Example with Python's cryptography package:

```python
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet
key = Fernet.generate_key()
cipher_suite = Fernet(key)

def encrypt_data(data):
    cipher_text = cipher_suite.encrypt(data)
    return cipher_text

def decrypt_data(cipher_text):
    plain_text = cipher_suite.decrypt(cipher_text)
    return plain_text
```


### Step 3: Proper Access Control
Ensure that proper access controls are in place such that users can only manipulate their own subscriptions.

```python
def change_subscription(user, new_plan):
    if user.has_permission('modify_subscription'):
        user.subscription_plan = new_plan
    else:
        raise PermissionError('User does not have permission to modify subscription')
```

### Step 4: Notify Users
Always notify users when the status of their subscriptions is changed, especially in the case of auto-renewals.

```python
def send_notification(user, message):
    # Code to send a notification to the user:
    pass

def change_subscription(user, new_plan):
    user.subscription_plan = new_plan
    send_notification(user, "Your subscription has been changed to: " + new_plan)
```

These steps can help in reducing the risk of manipulation of auto-renewals in subscriptions.
