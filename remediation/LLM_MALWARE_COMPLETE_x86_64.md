## Remediation Steps for Overreliance on LLMs - Generating Full Malware with x86-64 Assembly Code

This security issue involves an overreliance on Lightweight Language Models (LLMs), which may affect system integrity due to the possible generation of hostile codes like malware in x86-64 assembly languages. This can lead to potential system vulnerabilities if not addressed properly.

### Step 1: Implement Code Review and Regular Audit in Assembly

Regularly review and audit your Assembly codes. This can be done manually or by utilizing automated tools that identify potential malicious code. Code review is a crucial part of a secure coding life cycle.

```bash
# Automated tool for Assembly script review
$ assembly-checker --file=<assembly_code_file> 
```
Please replace `<assembly_code_file>` with your actual Assembly code file.

### Step 2: Employ a Secure Assembly Coding Practices

Ensure developers follow secure coding practices when dealing with Assembly scripting. Limit the use of potentially dangerous Assembly commands. 

```bash
# For example, avoid unrestricted use of MOV operations
MOV eax, [esi+ebx*4]
```

### Step 3: Use Secure Sandbox Environments

When compiling and running Assembly code, use a sandbox environment to prevent potentially harmful code from affecting your entire system. 

```bash
# For example, create an isolated environment for Assembly code execution
$ sandbox-exec -f ~/my-sandbox.sb ./my-assembly-code
```
