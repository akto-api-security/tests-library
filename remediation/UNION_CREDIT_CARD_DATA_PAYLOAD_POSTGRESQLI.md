# Remediation for UNION_CREDIT_CARD_DATA_PAYLOAD_POSTGRESQLI

## Remediation Steps for Union Based SQL Injection to Extract Credit Card Data in PostgreSQL

Union Based SQL Injection is a type of injection attack that leverages the UNION SQL operator to combine the results of the original query with results from injected malicious SQL statements. Attackers may use such methods to extract sensitive information such as Credit Card Data. 

### Step 1: Parameterized Query
Use parameterized queries (also known as prepared statements) to ensure all inputs are treated as literal values and not part of the SQL command. 

```python
from psycopg2 import sql, connect

def get_user(conn, user_id):
    with conn.cursor() as cursor:
        query = sql.SQL("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = %s")
        cursor.execute(query, [user_id])
    return cursor.fetchone()
``` 

### Step 2: Type Casting
Ensure that user inputs are typecasted to the appropriate data type in the application layer.

```python
def get_user(conn, user_id):
    if not user_id.isdigit():
        return None
    return _get_user(conn, int(user_id))
```

### Step 3: Least Privilege
Limit the database privileges. The database user the application uses should have no more than the required privileges. 

```sql
REVOKE ALL ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public FROM PUBLIC;
GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON TABLE public.users TO webapp;
```

### Step 4: Regular code review and Update
Regularly audit your codes to find unparameterized queries and convert them to parameterized ones. Keep your application and its dependencies up to date.

These are steps to protect the Credit Card Data against a Union Based SQL Injection in PostgreSQL. These steps mainly involve writing secure application code and properly managing database permissions.
