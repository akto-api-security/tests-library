# Remediation for RAILS_DEFAULT_HOMEPAGE_ENABLED

## Remediation Steps for Rails Default Homepage Enabled

Leaving the Rails default homepage enabled is a potential security risk, as it can reveal unnecessary information about your application to attackers.

### Step 1: Update Your Routes File
Open up your routes file, usually `config/routes.rb` in your Rails project directory. Ensure you replace the default route with a route to your own controller and action. Let's say you have HomeController with action index, the code will look as follows:
```ruby
# config/routes.rb
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  root 'home#index'
  #... other routes
end
```

### Step 2: Create The Controller and Action
Ensure that the corresponding controller `home` and action `index` mentioned in the routes exist. 

```ruby
# app/controllers/home_controller.rb
class HomeController < ApplicationController
  def index
    #... your logic
  end
end
```

### Step 3: Set Up A Corresponding View
Create the corresponding view for the controller and its action. Generally found in the `views` directory.

```html
<!-- app/views/home/index.html.erb -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My App</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My App</h1>
</body>
</html>
```
