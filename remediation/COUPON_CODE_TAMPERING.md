# Remediation for COUPON_CODE_TAMPERING

## Remediation Steps for Coupon Code Tampering

Coupon Code Tampering is a type of online security vulnerability wherein attackers manipulate coupon codes to get unauthorized discounts or benefits. Here are the steps for remediation:

### Step 1: Implement strong input validation

Online applications should only accept properly formatted coupon codes.

```python
import re

def validate_coupon(code):
    """returns True if the coupon code is in the proper format, false otherwise"""
    pattern = re.compile("COUP[\d]{10}")
    return bool(pattern.match(code))
```

### Step 2: Server side coupon code verification

Even if a client provides a code that is properly formatted, the server should still check whether that code is currently valid.

```python
def is_valid_coupon(code):
    """queries database to check if coupon code is valid and active"""
    # Assume connection to database is established
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute("SELECT EXISTS(SELECT 1 FROM Coupons WHERE Code=? AND IsActive=1)", (code, ))
    return bool(cursor.fetchone()[0])
```

### Step 3: Limit Number of Attempts

Implementing a rate limiting feature to restrict the number of times a user can try to apply different coupon codes can prevent aggressive coupon code tampering.

```python
from flask_limiter import Limiter
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)
limiter = Limiter(app, key_func=get_remote_address)

@app.route('/apply-coupon', methods=['POST'])
@limiter.limit("10/hour")
def apply_coupon():
    # Validate the coupon and give discount if valid
```

### Step 4: Frequent Coupon Code Change & Regular Audit

Rotate the coupon codes frequently and conduct regular audits of the system usage to detect potential suspicious activities early.

```bash
# Assuming a Unix-like Operating System
# Run this cron-job script every day at 00:00 hours

0 0 * * * python3 /path_to_script/coupon_rotation.py
```

### Step 5: Implementing strong encryption

It is important to use strong encryption when sending coupon codes from a server to a client.

```python
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
# NOTE: This is a stub for encryption. Please use proper keys and initialization vectors (IV)
cipher = AES.new(secret_key, AES.MODE_CBC, iv)
encrypted = cipher.encrypt(pad(code))
```
