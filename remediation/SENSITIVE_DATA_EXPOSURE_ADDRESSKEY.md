# Remediation for SENSITIVE_DATA_EXPOSURE_ADDRESSKEY

## Remediation Steps for Sensitive Data Exposure of ADDRESSKEY
Sensitive data exposure is a serious security issue wherein sensitive data like the ADDRESSKEY is not adequately protected, leading to the possibility of unauthorized access. Here are effective steps to mitigate this issue:

### Step 1: Data Encryption

Encrypt sensitive data at rest. One way to do this is by implementing AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) encryption. Here is an example in Python:
```python
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
import base64

def encrypt(key, source, encode=True):
    key = key.encode('utf-8')
    IV = 16 * '\x00'
    mode = AES.MODE_CBC
    encryptor = AES.new(key, mode, IV=IV)
    text = source + (16 - len(source) % 16) * '\x00'
    cipher = encryptor.encrypt(text.encode('utf-8'))
    return base64.b64encode(cipher).decode('utf-8') if encode else cipher

key = '<your-encryption-key>'
source = 'ADDRESSKEY'
encrypted_key = encrypt(key, source)
print('Encrypted:', encrypted_key)
```

### Step 2: Implement Secure Communication

Use HTTPS for secure communication. HTTPS ensures that the data transmitted between the server and client is encrypted and secure. If you're running a node.js server:
```javascript
var https = require('https');
var fs = require('fs');

var options = {
  key: fs.readFileSync('test/fixtures/keys/agent2-key.pem'),
  cert: fs.readFileSync('test/fixtures/keys/agent2-cert.pem')
};

https.createServer(options, function (req, res) {
  res.writeHead(200);
  res.end("Secure Site\n");
}).listen(8000);
```


### Step 3: Least Privilege Principle

Only grant essential system and data access rights to users and processes relevant to their roles. Unnecessary privileges should be avoided.

```python
class User:
    def __init__(self, name, role):
        self.name = name
        self.role = role
        self.privileges = self.get_privileges()

    def get_privileges(self):
        if self.role == "admin":
            return ["read", "write", "delete"]
        else:
            return ["read"]
```
      
These steps will significantly reduce the chance of sensitive data exposure and other security threats.
