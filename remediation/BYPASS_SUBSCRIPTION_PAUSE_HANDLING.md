## Remediation Steps for Bypass Subscription Pause Handling

Bypass Subscription Pause Handling is a serious security issue where a malicious user could potentially continue to access subscription-based privileges even after the subscription has been paused. 

Remediation would depend greatly on the system or platform in question and the language used, but below is a generalized example which may be adapted as necessary (using Python):

### Step 1: Validate the Subscription Status
Before granting access to services or content, confirm the subscription status of the user. 

```python
def is_subscription_active(user_id):
  """
  Function to check a user's subscription status
  """
  # Query the subscription status for user_id (assumption: this function exists in the system)
  subscription_status = query_user_subscription(user_id)

  # return True if status is "active", False otherwise
  return subscription_status == "active"
```

### Step 2: Conditionally Grant Access

Incorporate the function into your code to ensure checks are made to the user's subscription status before granting access to content. 

```python
def grant_access(user_id):
  """
  Function to grant access to subscription-based content
  """
  
  # Call the function to check the user's subscription status
  if is_subscription_active(user_id):
    # If status is active, grant access
    grant_subscription_access(user_id)
  else:
    # If status is not active, deny access
    deny_access(user_id)
```
