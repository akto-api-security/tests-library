# Remediation for REFERRAL_EXPLOITATION

## Remediation Steps for Exploiting Referral Programs
Exploiting referral programs is a type of security issue where attackers manipulate referral programs to gain unauthorized benefits. This may lead to a financial loss for a company and breach of user trust.

### Step 1: Validate Referral Codes
The first step in the remediation process is to validate all the referral codes. Every code should be linked to a valid user. Throw an error message if an invalid code is found.
```python
def validate_referral_code(code):
    user = User.query.filter_by(referral_code=code).first()
    if user is None:
        raise ValueError('Invalid referral code')
```

### Step 2: Limit the Number of Referrals per User
Each user should be limited to a certain number of referrals. You can limit this number in many ways, depending on your requirements.

```python
def check_user_referrals(user):
    referrals = Referral.query.filter_by(user_id=user.id).count()
    if referrals >= MAX_REFERRALS:
        raise ValueError('Referral limit reached')
```
### Step 3: Authenticate and Authorize Transactions
Ensure that all transactions involving referral codes are adequately authenticated and authorized. No unauthorized user should be able to gain benefits from the referral program.

```python
def authorize_transaction(user, referral_code):
    validate_user(user)
    validate_referral_code(referral_code)
    check_user_referrals(user)
```
