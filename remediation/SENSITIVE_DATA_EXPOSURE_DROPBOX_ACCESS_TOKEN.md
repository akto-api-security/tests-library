# Remediation for SENSITIVE_DATA_EXPOSURE_DROPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN

## Remediation Steps for Dropbox Access Token Exposure
Sensitive data such as a Dropbox Access Token being exposed is a serious security issue. If this token is exposed, it could be used to gain unauthorized access to the Dropbox data potentially affecting user privacy and data security.
### Step 1: Invalidate Existing Dropbox Access Token
You can invalidate the exposed access token using the following Python code (requires Dropbox SDK):
```python
import dropbox
dbx = dropbox.Dropbox('<YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>')
dbx.auth_token_revoke()
```
Replace '<YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>' with the actual access token you want to revoke. 

### Step 2: Generate a New Dropbox Access Token
Log in to the Dropbox App Console (https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps) and generate a new Access Token. Please keep it securely.

### Step 3: Securely Store the New Access Token
Rather than hardcoding sensitive data, it should be dynamically fetched from a secure location at runtime or securely stored within environment variables. Here's how you can set an environment variable in Python:
```python
import os
os.environ['DROPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN'] = "<YOUR_NEW_ACCESS_TOKEN>"
```
Replace '<YOUR_NEW_ACCESS_TOKEN>' with the new access token.
