## Remediation Steps for Django API Exception Error Detection using Special Characters

The handling of special characters plays a significant role in many security vulnerabilities. In this case, we will guide you to improve the handling of special characters within your Django APIs and how to properly handle exceptions.

### Step 1: Input Validation

It is important to validate the user input at the very beginning. You can use Django form validation or Django REST Framework's serializers.

```python
from django import forms

class MyForm(forms.Form):
    my_field = forms.CharField(max_length=100)

    def clean_my_field(self):
        data = self.cleaned_data['my_field']
    
        # Check for special characters
        if any(not c.isalnum() for c in data):
            raise forms.ValidationError("Invalid characters in input! Please remove any special characters.")

        return data
```

### Step 2: Exception Handling

Ensure that you handle the exceptions raised by the Django core using Django’s “`try...except`” blocks.

```python
from django.core.exceptions import ValidationError

try:
    # Some code that could potentially raise an exception
except ValidationError as e:
    # Handle the exception here
    print(e)
```

### Step 3: Log Exceptions Information

It might be helpful to log exception information for future reference as well as to debug the same.

```python
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

try:
    # Some code that could potentially raise an exception
except ValidationError as e:
    logger.exception(e)
```
