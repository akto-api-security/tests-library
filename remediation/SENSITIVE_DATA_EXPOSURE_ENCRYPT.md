# Remediation for SENSITIVE_DATA_EXPOSURE_ENCRYPT

## Remediation Steps for Sensitive Data Exposure for ENCRYPT

Sensitive data exposure for ENCRYPT is a serious security issue. Encryption should be used to protect sensitive data. Failing to properly encrypt and protect sensitive data can lead to unauthorized access or data breaches.

### Step 1: Identify Sensitive Data

Identify sensitive data that are collected, processed, or stored by the application. Sensitive data could include personally identifiable information (PII), passwords, financial data, etc.

### Step 2: Use Strong Encryption Algorithms

Implement well-vetted algorithms for encryption. Here is an example on how to encrypt and decrypt data using Python's cryptography library.

```python
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet
# generate a key
key = Fernet.generate_key()
cipher_suite = Fernet(key)

# to encrypt a message
data = b"Sensitive data that needs to be encrypted"
cipher_text = cipher_suite.encrypt(data)
print(cipher_text)

# to decrypt the message
plain_text = cipher_suite.decrypt(cipher_text)
print(plain_text)
```

### Step 3: Use Secure Protocols

Use secure communication protocols like HTTPS, to ensure the data in transit is encrypted.


### Step 4: Access Controls
Implement strong access controls to ensure only authorized individuals can access the encrypted data.
