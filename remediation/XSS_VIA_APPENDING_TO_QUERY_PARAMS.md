## Remediation Steps for XSS by appending to query parameters

Cross-site scripting (XSS) happens when a malicious actor injects scripts into web pages viewed by other users, effectively allowing the attacker to impersonate another user, perform actions on their behalf, or steal valuable information from them, among others. One way it's done is by appending to query parameters.

### Step 1: Validate and sanitize input

Before any user input is processed or incorporated into response data, make sure to properly validate it. This could be done using regular expressions or by leveraging built-in functions provided by your programming language of choice.

Here's an example of how it can be done in JavaScript:

```javascript
const sanitize = require('validator').sanitize;

// Get the user input
let userInput = req.query.id;

// Sanitize the user input
userInput = sanitize(userInput);
```

### Step 2: Output encoding

While sanitizing input is a good first step, it isn't always enough. Make sure to encode the output as well so even if an attacker manages to input malicious code, the harm done will be minimized.

Here's an example in Python using the cgi module:

```python
import cgi

# Get the user input
userInput = request.args.get('id')

# Encode the output
output = cgi.escape(userInput)
```

### Step 3: Content Security Policy

Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) which limits the types of code that can be ran on your web pages. This can serve as an additional layer of protection should input validation and output encoding be bypassed.

This is done through the HTTP response header as shown:

```bash
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'
```
