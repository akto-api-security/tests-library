# Remediation for SENSITIVE_DATA_EXPOSURE_FINNISH_PERSONAL_IDENTITY_NUMBER

## Remediation Steps for Sensitive Data Exposure for Finnish Personal Identity Number
Sensitive data exposure is a severe security issue. Without properly securing such data, attackers may gain unauthorized access to confidential information. In this instance we will focus on the Finnish Personal Identity Number (FINNISH PERSONAL IDENTITY NUMBER). 

### Step 1: Hashing
Use a secure and up-to-date hashing algorithm to store the Finnish Personal Identity Number (FINNISH PERSONAL IDENTITY NUMBER). Hashing is a one-way function that scrambles plain text to produce a unique message digest. This means that even if an attacker gains access to the hashed value, the actual Finnish Personal Identity Number remains secure.

Here is an example in Python of how to hash using the `hashlib` library:

```python
import hashlib

def hash_identity_number(identity_number):
    hash_object = hashlib.sha256(identity_number.encode())
    hashed_number = hash_object.hexdigest()
    return hashed_number

identity_number = "YOUR_IDENTITY_NUMBER"
hashed_identity_number = hash_identity_number(identity_number)
```

### Step 2: Encryption
All sensitive data, including the Finnish Personal Identity Number, should be encrypted during transit and at rest. Use HTTPS (HTTP Secure) protocol for data in transit.

### Step 3: Restrict Access
Restrict access to sensitive data only to authorized personnel. Implement appropriate user access controls and authentication mechanisms in your application.

### Step 4: Regular Audits
Regularly test and update your security measures. This includes checking for outdated encryption or hashing algorithms and replacing them with newer, more secure options.

### Step 5: Data Masking
Implement data masking solutions for non-production environments. This involves creating a structurally similar, but inauthentic, version of the data for testing and development purposes.
