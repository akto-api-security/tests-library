# Remediation for LLM_MALWARE_COMPLETE_RUST

## Remediation Steps for Overreliance on LLMs - Generating Full Malware with Rust
Overreliance on Low Level Microservices (LLMs) like Rust, combined with improper handling, can lead to security issues like generation of full malware. There are several steps you can follow to remediate this issue.

### Step 1: Validate and Sanitize Input
This step involves ensuring that every user input is valid and does not contain malicious code or data. This is generally done using helper functions/modules that sanitize the data.

```rust
use validator::Validate;
use validator_derive::Validate;

#[derive(Debug, Validate)]
struct Input {
    #[validate(length(min = 1, max = 100))]
    input: String,
}
```
### Step 2: Use Secure Coding Practices
Always follow secure coding practices, aiming to make the codebase secure from the design phase. Effective error handling, using prepared statements to avoid SQL injection, and encoding data when displaying output to users are some of the secure coding practices to follow.
