# Remediation for SENSITIVE_DATA_EXPOSURE_PIN

## Remediation Steps for Sensitive Data Exposure for PIN

Sensitive data exposure, such as a Personal Identification Number (PIN), is a significant security issue. This can occur if PINs are stored or transmitted insecurely. The below steps will involve remediations using secure handling and storage methods.

### Step 1: Always Hash and Salt PINs

Instead of storing the original PINs, store hashed and salted PINs instead. This ensures that even if the data is breached, the PINs remain secure.

```python
import hashlib
import os

def hash_pin(pin):
    salt = os.urandom(32)
    hashed_pin = hashlib.pbkdf2_hmac('sha256', pin.encode('utf-8'), salt, 100000)
    return salt, hashed_pin
```

### Step 2: Secure Transmission of PINs

Always ensure that PINs are transferred over a secure connection, such as HTTPS, to prevent interception by malicious entities.

```python
# This does not require explicit code. It's a matter of configuring your server to use HTTPS.
```

### Step 3: Use Secure Methods for PIN Recovery

Avoid using insecure PIN recovery methods like security questions, which could be easily guessed by someone else. Consider using methods like sending a temporary recovery code via email or text message.

```python
import smtplib

def send_recovery_email(email, temporary_code):
    with smtplib.SMTP('smtp.example.com', 587) as smtp:
        smtp.sendmail('noreply@example.com', email, 'Your temporary code is: ' + temporary_code)
```

### Step 4: Lock the account after multiple unsuccessful attempts

The system should temporarily lock the account if there are too many failed login attempts in a given time frame.

```python
MAX_FAILS = 3

def check_login_attempts(failed_attempts):
    if failed_attempts >= MAX_FAILS:
        return True  # Lock the account
    return False  # Don't lock the account
```
