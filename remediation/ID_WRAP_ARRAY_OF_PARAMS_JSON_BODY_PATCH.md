## Remediation Steps for BOLA via JSON Param

BOLA (Broken Object Level Authorization) via JSON parameter exploitation is a concerning security issue. If not correctly addressed, attackers can manipulate the structure of input parameters, resulting in unauthorized access to resources.

### Step 1: Input Validation
To protect against this vulnerability, it is crucial to validate input before it is processed. 

In JAVA, you can use commonly used libraries for JSON validation such as `javax.validation` or `org.springframework.validation` :

```java
import org.springframework.validation.annotation.Validated;
import javax.validation.constraints.NotEmpty;

@Validated
public class User {
    
    @NotEmpty(message = "User name cannot be empty")
    private String userName;
    
    // getters and setters

}
```

### Step 2: Implement Strong Access Controls
Proper and strong access controls ensure that only authorized users have the capacity to access certain data.

Following is a Python snippet using Flask and Flask-Security to implement role-based access control:

```python
from flask import Flask
from flask_security import Security, SQLAlchemyUserDatastore, \
    UserMixin, RoleMixin, login_required

# Flask app setup
app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['SECRET_KEY'] = 'super-secret'

# Flask-Security setup
user_datastore = SQLAlchemyUserDatastore(db, User, Role)
security = Security(app, user_datastore)

@app.route('/admin')
@roles_required('admin')  # Example of role-based access control
@login_required
def admin_home():
    return render_template('admin_home.html')
```
### Step 3: Regular Audit and Update
Auditing your APIs routinely and updating your security measures according to the latest standards and threats should be a part of your security regimen. 

This may include code reviews, penetration testing, and dependancy checking etc. A common tool for security auditing and updates can be the OWASP Zap.

```bash
docker run -t owasp/zap2docker-stable zap-baseline.py -t https://yourwebsite.com
```

Always ensure to conform to the principles of least privilege while granting access controls.
