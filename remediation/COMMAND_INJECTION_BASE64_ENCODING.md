# Remediation for COMMAND_INJECTION_BASE64_ENCODING

## Remediation Steps for Command Injection via Base64 Encoding with echo

Command injection is a serious security flaw that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on a system. In this case, the hazardous scenario begins when base64 encoded data with a malicious command is used as input and 'echo' command is used to decode and execute it.

Here is how you can mitigate such a vulnerability in a code snippet written in Python.

### Step 1: Avoid direct use of shell commands

Avoid using shell commands that have command injection flaws. Use less hazardous methods that don't pass direct shell commands.

```python
# Vulnerable code
import os
os.system("echo d2hvYW1p | base64 --decode")

# Secure code
import base64
print(base64.b64decode("d2hvYW1p").decode())
```

### Step 2: Validate and sanitize inputs

All user inputs must be validated and sanitized. Limit input length and only allow specific known good input.

```python
def sanitize(input):
    whitelist = set('abcde...'
                    'ABCDEFGHI...'
                    '0123456789+/=') 
    return ''.join(filter(whitelist.__contains__, input))
```

### Step 3: Use Parameterized Functions

When it is mandatory to use shell commands, use parameterized functions that prevent passing arbitrary commands.

```python
# Secure way using subprocess module
import subprocess
result = subprocess.run(['echo', 'd2hvYW1p'], stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
print(base64.b64decode(result.stdout).decode())
```
