## Remediation Steps for Overreliance on LLMs - Generating Malware Payloads with x86-64 Assembly Code

Overreliance on Low-Level Microcode (LLMs) such as x86-64 Assembly code for generating payloads can cause significant security vulnerabilities. This can inadvertently create points where malicious actors may inject or modify code, thereby leading to severe security breaches. Here are some remediation steps:

### Step 1: Input Validation and Sanitization

Implement input validation and sanitization to ensure that any input is legal, valid, and secure.

```python
# Python code snippet for input validation and sanitization
def sanitize_input(input):
    # Add sanitization logic here
    sanitized_input = ""
    
    return sanitized_input
```

### Step 2: Implement Runtime Code Integrity Checks

Implement runtime code integrity checks to verify the integrity of executing code. 

**Note:** This is just an illustrative example. Code integrity checks should be tailored to your particular environment and requirements.

```python
# Python code snippet for runtime code integrity check
def check_code_integrity(code):
    # Add code integrity verification logic here
    integrity_status = True
    
    return integrity_status
```

### Step 3: Limit and Control Assembly Code Generation

Control and limit who, when, and how assembly code is being generated in your system. Implement access control and tiered privileges.

No explicit source code example can be given for this since it heavily depends on your system architecture and existing security infrastructure. This involves changes at an architectural level.
