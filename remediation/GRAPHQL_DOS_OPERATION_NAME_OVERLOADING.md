# Remediation for GRAPHQL_DOS_OPERATION_NAME_OVERLOADING

## Remediation Steps for Denial of Service Test on GraphQL API with OperationName Overloading 

Denial of Service (DoS) caused by OperationName overloading in single request on GraphQL API could potentially overload your systems leading to service interruptions. Here are remediation steps to mitigate this security issue:

### Step 1: Implement Request Throttling 

Request throttling prevents a single client from making too many requests to the server within a specified time frame and overloading the server.

Below is an example of how one might implement this in Node.js environment with express.js and express-rate-limit middleware:

```javascript
const rateLimit = require("express-rate-limit");

// Enable if you're behind a reverse proxy (Heroku, Bluemix, AWS ELB, Nginx, etc)
app.set('trust proxy', 1);

const limiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 100, // limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
  message: "Too many requests from this IP, please try again later"
});

//  apply to all requests
app.use(limiter);
```

### Step 2: Use a Query Complexity Analysis Tool

Query Complexity Analysis can prevent resource exhaustion attacks by refusing to execute queries that exceed a certain complexity measurement.

In JavaScript, you could use the `graphql-validation-complexity` library:

```javascript
const { createComplexityLimitRule } = require('graphql-validation-complexity');

const validationRules = [
    createComplexityLimitRule(1000, {
        onCost: (cost) => {
            console.log('query cost: ', cost);
        }
    }),
];

app.use('/graphql', graphqlHTTP({
    schema,
    graphiql: true,
    validationRules
}));
```

### Step 3: Avoid Exposing Detailed Error Information to Clients

Exposing detailed error information can give attackers a clue about how to exploit the vulnerability in your system. In production, only send generalized error messages to the client.

```javascript
app.use(function(err, req, res, next) {
  console.error(err.stack);
  res.status(500).send('Something broke!');
});
```

### Step 4: Regular Audit and Update

Regularly audit your systems for any vulnerable packages and keep them updated.

```bash
npm audit
npm update
```

## Caution

These remediations steps greatly reduce the risk of DoS attacks due to OperationName overloading on GraphQL APIs, but no solution is completely infallible. In addition to these steps, maintain good security practices, such as regular audits and the use of secure connections.
