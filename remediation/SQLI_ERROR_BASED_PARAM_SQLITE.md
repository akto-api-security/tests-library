# Remediation for SQLI_ERROR_BASED_PARAM_SQLITE

## Remediation Steps for Error-Based SQL Injection for SQLite Parameters
Error-based SQL injection vulnerabilities are a serious threat to any web application as they allow malicious actors to manipulate SQL queries to gain unauthorized access to data and potentially cause data loss or corruption. Follow the steps below to secure your SQLite parameters.

### Step 1: Use Parameterized Queries
The primary defense against SQL injection attacks is to use parameterized queries or prepared statements. This ensures the data passed into the queries are handled in a secure manner that mitigates the risk of injection.

```python
import sqlite3

def get_user(user_id):
    conn = sqlite3.connect('database.sqlite')
    cursor = conn.cursor()

    cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id=?", (user_id,))
    return cursor.fetchall()
```

### Step 2: Design Appropriate User Privileges
Applications should always run with the least privileges necessary to perform their operations. This helps to limit any potential damage in case of a breach or vulnerability exploit.

```bash
sudo -u limited_user command_to_run_application
```

### Step 3: Input Validation
Always validate input from users and filter out any unwanted characters that could be used to perform an attack. This, combined with using parameterized queries, can significantly reduce the risk of SQL injection.

```python
import re

def sanitize_input(user_input):
    return re.sub('[^A-Za-z0-9]+', '', user_input)
```
