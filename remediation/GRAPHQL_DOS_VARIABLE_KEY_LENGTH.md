## Remediation Steps for Denial of Service Test on GraphQL API with Very Long Key Name

A Denial of Service (DoS) attack where the key name in the variable object of a GraphQL API request is excessively long can have detrimental effects on the system's performance. Here are the steps to mitigate the DoS vulnerability.

### Step 1: Limit Size of Key Names
Implement limitations on the length of the key names in the variable object of a GraphQL API request. This can be done effectively with a middleware.

```javascript
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  const MAX_KEY_SIZE = 256;
  for (let key in req.body.variables) {
    if (key.length > MAX_KEY_SIZE) {
      return res.status(400).send(`Key ${key} is too long.`);
    }
  }
  next();
});
```

### Step 2: Use a Rate Limiter
Using a rate limiter can also prevent a DoS attack by limiting the number of requests a single client can make within a given time frame.

```javascript
const rateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');

const limiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 100 // limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
});

app.use(limiter);
```

### Step 3: Implement GraphQL depth limit
Prevent overly nested queries (complex queries) which can harm server performance as they might require a lot of computing resources. A module like 'graphql-depth-limit' can be used.

```javascript
const depthLimit = require('graphql-depth-limit');
const {createServer} = require('http');
const express = require('express');
const {ApolloServer} = require('apollo-server-express');
const typeDefs = require('./schema');

const server = new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs,
  validationRules: [depthLimit(3)]
});

const app = express();
server.applyMiddleware({app});

const httpServer = createServer(app);
httpServer.listen({port: 3000}, ()=> console.log('Server started on port 3000'));
```
