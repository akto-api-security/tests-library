# Remediation for BYPASS_FEE_APPLICATION_VERIFICATION

## Remediation Steps for Bypassing Fee Application on Transactions

Bypassing the fee application on transactions is a serious security vulnerability. It allows potential attackers to perform transactions without paying the required fees, leading to revenue loss and potential exploitation of the system. 

For this example, let's take a look at a hypothetical system where the fee is applied during a transaction. If the weakness is found in the software code, it can be fixed by ensuring every transaction goes through the necessary fee check and deduction step before it's completed.

### Step 1: Ensure Fee Deduction Logic 

Ensure the transaction processing logic includes a step, where the required fee is deducted from the user. For this step, JavaScript is used with a simple if-else logic.

```javascript
function processTransaction(amount, userBalance, fee) {
  if(userBalance < amount + fee) {
    console.log('Insufficient balance for transaction and fee.');
    return false;
  } else {
    userBalance = userBalance - amount - fee;
    console.log('Transaction and fee processed successfully.');
    return true;
  }
}
```
### Step 2: Validate User Input 

Perform robust input validation to prevent users from manipulating the values to bypass the fee application. This could be achieved through server-side and client-side validation checks.

```javascript
function validateInput(amount, userBalance, fee) {
  if(amount <= 0 || userBalance <= 0 || fee < 0) {
    console.log('Invalid input values.');
    return false;
  } else {
    return true;
  }
}
```
