## Remediation Steps for Fuzzing Cookie Data: Exploiting BOLA for Unauthorized Access for PATCH/PUT method APIs

Fuzzing Cookie Data exploiting Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA) for unauthorized access to PATCH/PUT method APIs can enable potential attackers to manipulate the API's behavior by modifying cookie data. 

Here are some steps for mitigation:

### Step 1: Validate and Sanitize User Input
Always validate and sanitize user input including Cookie Data. This shields your API from SQL injection and Cross Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. Consider using built-in functions provided by most web development frameworks.

```javascript
let sanitizedInput = encodeURI(userInput);
```

### Step 2: Implement Proper Content Security Policy
A properly implemented Content Security Policy (CSP) could restrict where the resources can be loaded and limit the ways JavaScript can be executed.

```html
<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="default-src 'none'; script-src 'self'; connect-src 'self'; img-src 'self'; style-src 'self';">
```

### Step 3: Implement Robust Access Control
Instead of using cookies, consider using tokens that are securely tied to the user's session. Entire user context should be embedded into the session token.

```javascript
app.use(session({
  secret: 'your-secret',
  resave: false,
  saveUninitialized: true,
  cookie: { secure: true }
}))
```
