# Remediation for CONTENT_TYPE_HEADER_MISSING

## Remediation Steps for Content-Type Header Missing

The absence of the Content-Type header can lead to security vulnerabilities as it paves the way for attackers to interpret the data in a malicious way. Therefore, it is crucial to set the Content-Type header correctly to prevent such attacks.

### Step 1: Setting the Content-Type header for every response

Use the appropriate programming language and framework to set the Content-Type header for every HTTP response. Here is an example using Node.js with Express:

```javascript
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json');
  next();
});
```

### Step 2: Validate all incoming requests

Ensure to validate all incoming requests. If the content type of the incoming request is not as expected, reject the request. Here is an example:

```javascript
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  const contentType = req.headers['content-type'];
  if (!contentType || !contentType.includes('application/json')) {
    return res.status(400).send('Invalid content type. Expecting application/json');
  }
  next();
});
```
