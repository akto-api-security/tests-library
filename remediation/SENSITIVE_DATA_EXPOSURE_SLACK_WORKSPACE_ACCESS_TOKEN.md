# Remediation for SENSITIVE_DATA_EXPOSURE_SLACK_WORKSPACE_ACCESS_TOKEN

## Remediation Steps for Slack Workspace Access Token Exposure
Exposure of Slack Workspace Access Tokens can lead to unauthorized access to your Slack workspace. This data is sensitive and should always be stored securely. Here are steps to remediate this security issue:

### Step 1: Regenerate Tokens
Regenerate any compromised tokens immediately. The previously exposed tokens will automatically be invalidated.

```python
import slack_sdk

# Create a client instance
client = slack_sdk.WebClient(token='paste-your-new-token-here')

# Verify that the token works
response = client.auth_test()
```

### Step 2: Store Tokens Securely
Store your Slack tokens securely. One method is to use environmental variables. 

```python
import os
from slack_sdk import WebClient

# Load the Slack token as an environment variable
slack_token = os.environ["SLACK_API_TOKEN"]

# Create the client using the loaded token
client = WebClient(token=slack_token)
```

### Step 3: Limit Token Scope
Limit the scopes assigned to each Slack token. The more capabilities a token has, the more damage can be done if it's exposed. Only assign the scopes a token needs for its tasks.

```python
response = client.oauth_v2_access(
    client_id="your-client-id",
    client_secret="your-client-secret",
    code="user-entered-code"
)
```
