# Remediation for NEXT_JS_CACHE_POISONING

## Remediation Steps for Next.JS Cache Poisoning

Next.JS Cache Poisoning is a serious security hole. If this vulnerability is exploited, an attacker could poison the Next.JS app's cache and steal sensitive information or manipulate contents in unauthorized ways.

### Step 1: Always validate and sanitize user inputs

Ensure any data originating from user inputs is sanitized and validated before using it to interact with cache. This reduces the probability of cache tampering.

```javascript
const sanitize = require('validator').sanitize;
//...
let userInput = req.body.userInput;
userInput = sanitize(userInput);
```

### Step 2: Use a secure and updated version of Next.JS

Always use the most recent version of Next.JS. The maintainers are constantly fixing bugs and patching security vulnerabilities, so ensuring the application uses the latest version is vital.

```bash
npm install next@latest
```

### Step 3: Specific Cache Control

Control the caching behavior explicitly using `res.setHeader`. For example, you can prevent caching of sensitive data.
```javascript
res.setHeader('Cache-Control', 'no-store');
```

### Step 4: Regular Audit and Update

Regularly audit your application's security, and update your dependencies.

```bash
npm audit
npm update
```

As with any vulnerability, the remediation process might differ according to specific system and application needs. Always follow security best practices and consider security in every step of your software development life cycle.
