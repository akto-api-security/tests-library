# Remediation for AUTH_BYPASS_PASSWORD_RESET

## Remediation Steps for Authentication Bypass via Password Reset Endpoint

Authentication bypass by replaying the password reset flow may allow unauthorized users to assume the identities of other users. By introducing proper verification steps and secure token handling, systems can mitigate this vulnerability. 

### Step 1: Generate Secure Tokens
Generate secure and unique tokens that are hard to guess. Save them in the database mapped to the user account that requested the password reset, and send it over link via email.

```python
import os
import hashlib

def generate_token():
    return hashlib.sha256(os.urandom(60)).hexdigest()
```

### Step 2: Set token validity
Define a validity duration for the token to automatically expire if not used within the said duration.

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

def set_token_expiry():
    return datetime.now() + timedelta(hours=1)
```

### Step 3: Token Validation 
Validate the token from password reset request. If the token has expired or does not match the one in database, redirect back to password reset request.

```python
def validate_token(user, token):
    reset_record = get_password_reset_record(user)
    if reset_record.token == token and reset_record.expiry> datetime.now():
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

### Step 4: Invalidate Token post use
Once the password reset is successful, ensure that the token is invalidated or deleted and cannot be used again.

```python
def invalidate_token(user):
    reset_record = get_password_reset_record(user)
    if reset_record:
        delete_password_reset_record(user)
```

### Step 5: Secure Token Transmission 
Use HTTPS for sending password reset emails which includes the token. This prevents network eavesdropping and the potential for token theft.
