## Remediation Steps for Union Based SQL Injection on Login Endpoints

In union based SQL injection attacks, an attacker exploits web applications which construct SQL statements from user-supplied data. Here's how you can remediate this vulnerability.

### Step 1: Validate and Sanitize Input
Before using user inputs in SQL statements, you should verify the data for safety. Most programming languages have libraries for this purpose, and certain databases have built-in features to prevent SQL injection.

```python
from flask import request
from werkzeug.datastructures import MultiDict

def validate_input(input):
    if isinstance(input, MultiDict):
        input = input.to_dict()
    for k, v in input.items():
        v = v.strip()
        if not v.isalnum():
            return False
    return True

@app.route('/login', methods=['POST'])
def login():
    data = request.form
    if not validate_input(data):
        return 'Invalid input'
    # Rest of the code...
```

### Step 2: Use Parameterized Queries
Parameterizing the query beforehand can prevent an SQL injection. This makes sure parameters can't be confused with actual SQL code.

```python
from flask import Flask, request
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy

app = Flask(__name__)
db = SQLAlchemy(app)

@app.route('/login', methods=['POST'])
def login():
    username = request.form['username']
    password = request.form['password']
    user = db.session.query(User).filter(User.username==username, User.password==password).first()
    # Rest of the code...
```

### Step 3: Apply Least Privilege Principle
Limit the privileges of database accounts that your application uses. This will restrict the potential impact of SQL Injection attack.

```bash
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON dbname.* TO 'username'@'hostname';
```

### Step 4: Regularly Monitor and Update Application
Regularly review and update your application to prevent any unpatched security vulnerabilities.

### Step 5: Use Web Application Firewall
A web application firewall (WAF) examines HTTP traffic to identify any suspicious activity and it can block these requests. Use a WAF to protect your application from SQL Injection attacks.
