## Remediation Steps for Bypass Registration and Booking Date Handling
Bypass Registration and Booking Date Handling are common threats, especially in web applications. This circumvents the access control, allowing unauthorized users to utilize services, and misuse booking processes to potentially harm the business.

### Step 1: Enforce User Authentication and Authorization
Ensure that registration and authentication systems are fully enforced. This can be achieved by requiring user login for certain actions on your website. In PHP, for instance, this could look like this:

```php
session_start();
if(!isset($_SESSION['loggedin']) || $_SESSION['loggedin'] == false){
   header("Location: login.php");
}
```
Above code will check whether the user is logged in every session, and if not, will redirect them to the login page.

### Step 2: Implement Backend Validation for Booking Dates
Backend validation should be mandatory to prevent inappropriate booking date selections. A validation function in Python could be used in such situations:

```python
from datetime import datetime

def validate_date(booking_date):
    current_date = datetime.now()
    if booking_date < current_date:
        raise ValueError("The booking date cannot be in the past!")

# example usage:
validate_date(user_provided_date)
```
With this, you protect yourself against invalid bookings, as the function will raise an error if the booking date is in the past.

### Step 3: Limit User Roles
Not every user should have the same permission level. Standard users should not have administrative permissions. In Java, you could use the following structure to grant permissions based on the user role:

```java
public class User {
    private String role;
    public User(String role) {
    this.role = role;
    }
    boolean hasPermission(String action) {
        if("admin".equals(this.role)) {
            return true;
        } else if ("user".equals(this.role) && "book".equals(action)) {
            return true;
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    }
}
```
In this example, only the admin users have a full access, while normal users are limited to the "book" action.
