# Remediation for COMMAND_INJECTION_WITH_ENCODING_AND_CHAINING

## Remediation Steps for Command Injection Vulnerability

The threat of Command Injection is a serious security issue. It provides attackers with an avenue to execute arbitrary commands on a host operating system, which can potentially lead to the compromise of the entire system.

### Step 1: Avoid using system commands directly

26
Wherever possible, you should aim to use library functions or other APIs that provide the functionality you need. If that's not possible, built-in language features can often offer a safe alternative to system commands. For example, in Python, you might use the `os` or `subprocess` libraries to interact with the system:

```python
import os
os.makedirs('/path/to/directory')

import subprocess
subprocess.run(['ls', '-l'])
```

### Step 2: Input Validation

Strictly validate user inputs. Only alphanumeric characters should be allowed. Special characters associated with command execution (*, &, ^, %, $, #, @, !) should be filtered out.

```python
def sanitize(user_input):
    return ''.join(e for e in user_input if e.isalnum())
```

### Step 3: Use Parameterized Functions

When it is necessary to use system commands, use interfaces that allow command parameters to be specified as separate arguments to avoid command chaining:

```python
subprocess.run(['touch', user_input])
```

Note: `user_input` should be the sanitized user input.

### Step 4: Principle of Least Privilege

Run your application processes with the least privileges necessary to perform their function. This limits the potential damage of a successful command injection attack.

```bash
sudo -u limited_user yourProgram
```

### Step 5: Regular Audit and Update

Regularly update your system and third-party packages to benefit from the latest security patches. 

No vulnerabilities are completely unavoidable, but these steps can greatly mitigate the risks associated with Command Injection attacks.
