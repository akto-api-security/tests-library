# Remediation for CORS_MISCONFIGURATION_INVALID_ORIGIN

## Remediation Steps for Invalid Origin CORS Misconfiguration Detection

Invalid Origin CORS Misconfiguration is a critical security issue. If not dealt properly, it can compromise the system and can give unauthorized access to sensitive information.

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a mechanism that uses additional HTTP headers to tell a browser to let a web application running at one origin (domain) have permission to access selected resources from a server at a different origin.

### Step 1: Correctly configure the CORS
```Javascript
// For JavaScript running Node.js with Express.js 

var express = require('express')
var cors = require('cors')
var app = express()
 
app.use(cors())

// ...
```

This code will allow any origin to access your resources, but you can specify and strictly implement which origins are allowed by following: 

```Javascript
var corsOptions = {
  origin: 'http://example.com',
  optionsSuccessStatus: 200 // For legacy browser support
}

app.use(cors(corsOptions));
```

### Step 2: Validate Origin

Always validate the origin. Don't return the input from `request.headers.origin` directly.

### Step 3: Limit the verbs (methods)

Not every feature of your API needs to support every verb. CORS should be as strict as possible. Allow what is required.

```Javascript
app.options('/data', cors()) // enable pre-flight request for /data route
```

### Step 4: Regular Audit

Continuously review your CORS policy. Be cautious while exposing new endpoints or data. Implement warnings when changes on CORS policy occur.

NOTE: While CORS is defense strategy against certain classes of attacks (broadly speaking, it's server-side protection from misuse of resources), enforcing HTTPS in conjunction with a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) provides a more robust defense.
