## Remediation Steps for Command Injection in URL Path with Chained System Instructions

Command injections in URL paths can be dangerous, leaving an application open to exploitation. This particular situation becomes even more risky if there are chained system instructions involved. Here are the steps to mitigate such security breaches.

### Step 1: Validate Input
Ensure all user inputs are validated properly before execution. This can prevent attackers from executing arbitrary commands. Most programming languages provide functions for this.

In PHP, for instance, use the `escapeshellarg` or `escapeshellcmd` functions.

```php
$userInput = $_GET['userInput'];
$cleanInput = escapeshellarg($userInput);
system("ls -l $cleanInput");
```
In Python, we can use the `shlex.quote` or `subprocess` functions.

```python
import shlex, subprocess
user_input = "arbitrary command"
safe_user_input = shlex.quote(user_input)
subprocess.run("ls -l "+ safe_user_input, shell=True)
```

### Step 2: Incorporate Output Encoding
Whenever you output the data received as input from users, make sure to encode the output. 

### Step 3: Use Least Privilege Principle
Run applications with as few privileges as possible to reduce the effect of any successful attacks. 


### Step 4: Restrict Inputs
If possible, avoid allowing user-defined fields to accept special characters.
