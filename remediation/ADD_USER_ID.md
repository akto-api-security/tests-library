# Remediation for ADD_USER_ID

## Remediation Steps for IDOR by adding User ID in Query Params 

Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) occurs when an application uses user-supplied input to access objects directly. It leads to unauthorized access to data, as an user can simply modify the value of a parameter in the URL. 

### Step 1: Validate User Input

User input validation plays a crucial role in the web application security. 

Here is an example using Python's `Flask` web framework:

```python
from flask import request, jsonify
from schema import Schema, And

def validate_id(request):
    schema = Schema(And(int, lambda n: 0 < n < 10**10))
    try:
        schema.validate(int(request.args.get('id')))
    except Exception:
        return jsonify({"message": "Invalid ID provided!"}), 400
```

### Step 2: Implement Proper Access Controls 

Ensure that the user is permitted to access the specific resource. Here is one way to implement access control using Django (Python):

```python
from django.core.exceptions import PermissionDenied

def get(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
    user = User.objects.get(id=kwargs['id'])

    if request.user != user:
        raise PermissionDenied()

    return super().get(request, *args, **kwargs)
```

### Step 3: Use UUID instead of Simple Incremental IDs

UUIDs are unique, which makes guessing them a near impossibility. This can be used instead of IDs. Here is an example with Python:

```python
import uuid

def generate_uuid():
    return uuid.uuid4()
```

### Step 4: Audit your code regularly

Remember, regular updates and audits of your codebase can prevent such security issues. Regularly test your software, be it manually or using automated tools, for security vulnerabilities to ensure their non-existence.
