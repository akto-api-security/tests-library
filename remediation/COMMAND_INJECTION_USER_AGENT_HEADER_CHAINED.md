## Remediation Steps for Command Injection in User-Agent Header

Command injection in the User-Agent header can allow a malicious user to execute arbitrary system commands on the server side. This can lead to serious issues like data breaches, unauthorized operations, and even complete system takeover. To fix this issue we need to apply input validation and sanitization.

### Step 1: Input Validation
First, we should validate the User-Agent input before processing it. We only accept the known good inputs.

```python
import re

def valid_user_agent(user_agent):
  pattern = re.compile(r"^[a-zA-Z0-9/\-.;() ]+$")
  return bool(pattern.match(user_agent))
```
This Python function will only allow alphanumerical characters, slashes, dashes, semicolons, parenthesis, and spaces in the User-Agent. Any other input will be considered invalid.

### Step 2: Input Sanitization
We also need to sanitize any input we get to the User-Agent.

```python
def sanitize_user_agent(user_agent):
  return user_agent.replace(";", "").replace("&", "")
```
This Python function sanitizes the input by removing semicolons and ampersands which are usually used to chain commands in Unix-based systems.

### Step 3: Apply validation and sanitization
Every User-Agent input should be validated and sanitized before usage.

```python
user_agent = get_user_agent()  # Function to get user agent from HTTP request headers
if valid_user_agent(user_agent):
  sanitized_user_agent = sanitize_user_agent(user_agent)
else:
  raise ValueError("Invalid User-Agent")
```
