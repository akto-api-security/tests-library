# Remediation for BYPASS_AGE_RESTRICTION

## Remediation Steps for Bypassing Age Restrictions
Bypassing age restrictions is crucially an ethical issue as well as a legal liability and can be prevented by enforcing strict methods for age verification.

### Step 1: Frontend Validation
Firstly, setup a birthday or age input field. This should be used to collect the user's age or date of birth.
```html
<form>
  <label for="dob">Date of Birth:</label>
  <input type="date" id="dob" name="dob">
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
```
We can't rely solely on frontend validation, but it can help prevent simple mistakes.

### Step 2: Backend Verification
The entered date is verified on the backend. The backend calculates age from the entered date and proceeds only if the user is of acceptable age. This Python example shows you how you can calculate the age.
```python
from datetime import date

def calculate_age(born):
    today = date.today()
    return today.year - born.year - ((today.month, today.day) < (born.month, born.day))

dob = date(2000, 12, 5)
age = calculate_age(dob)

if age < 18:
    print('Access denied. User is a minor.')
else:
    print('Access granted.')
```
### Step 3: Conditional Access
Access to restricted content should only be granted after the user has passed the age verification.

This strategy isn't foolproof, as users can still provide faulty information, but doing so will typically constitute as a legal issue for them. 

More sophisticated methods can be implemented accordingly to business needs, like integrating third-party ID verification services.

### Step 4: Regular Audit and Update
The system should be regularly audited to find potential loopholes and it should be updated to ensure the latest security patches are integrated. 

In conclusion, these remediation steps provide a simple and quick solution to tackle the problem but in a more secure and critical environment, the application's access should be guarded with much advanced and sophisticated techniques.
