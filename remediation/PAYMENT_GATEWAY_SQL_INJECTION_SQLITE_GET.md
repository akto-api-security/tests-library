# Remediation for PAYMENT_GATEWAY_SQL_INJECTION_SQLITE_GET

## Remediation Steps for SQL Injection on Payment Gateway API

SQL Injection is a serious security vulnerability that involves exploiting an application's data interaction with an underlying database. An attacker can manipulate SQL statements through application inputs. Here we discuss remediation steps for SQLite and GET method APIs.

### Step 1: Validate Input
Application inputs should not trust user inputs and always validate them before processing. Here's how you can do this in Python:

```python
def validate_input(input):
    valid_input = re.sub(r"[^\w\s]", "", input)
    return valid_input
```
### Step 2: Use Parameterized Queries
Parameterized queries ensure that the parameters (inputs) passed into SQL statements are treated safely, resulting in a significantly reduced risk of SQL injection. Here's how you can use parameterized queries with SQLite in Python:

```python
import sqlite3

def execute_query_safe(query, parameters):
    conn = sqlite3.connect('my_database.db')
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    
    cursor.execute(query, parameters)

    conn.commit()
    conn.close()
```

### Step 3: Apply Least Privilege Principle
Limit the privileges of the accounts that run your application/queries. This can protect your data even if an attacker manages to perform SQL injection.

```sql
CREATE ROLE 'limited_user' WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'password';
GRANT SELECT ON table_to_access TO limited_user;
```

### Step 4: Encryption
Use encryption for all the sensitive data to add an extra level of security.

### Step 5: Regular Code Review
Regular code reviews can help identify potential SQL injection threats in a timely manner. Automated tools, such as static analysis tools, can also help in a large codebase.

### Step 6: Regular Database Backup
Regular backups of your database can help recover lost data in case of a successful SQL injection attack. Please note that this is a mitigation step rather than a prevention step. 

```bash
sqlite3 my_database.db ".backup 'backup.db'"
```

With these steps, you should be able to prevent most SQL Injection attempts on your payment gateway API.
