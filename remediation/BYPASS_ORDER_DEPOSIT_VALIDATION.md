# Remediation for BYPASS_ORDER_DEPOSIT_VALIDATION

## Remediation Steps for Deposit Validation Bypass vulnerability
Deposit Validation Bypass effectively compromises your system by allowing unauthorized users to place orders and pre-orders without actual deposit validation. This could lead to significant revenue loss over time.

### Step 1: Validate Deposits on the Server Side

All user inputs and transactions need to be validated at the server side. This is crucial as bypassing client-side validation is way easier for attackers. In C# one might implement this by:

```csharp
public bool IsDepositValid(Order order, double deposit)
{
  if (deposit >= order.MinimumDeposit)
  {
    return true;
  }
  else
  {
    throw new Exception("Deposit is less than the minimum required deposit.");
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Implement Strong User Authentication

A strong user authentication system is necessary to make sure only authorized users can place orders and pre-orders.

```java
public boolean isAuthenticated(String username, String password) {
 SaltedMD5 s = new SaltedMD5();
  String hashedPassword = s.getSecurePassword(password);
 if (usersDB.authenticate(username, hashedPassword)) {
  return true;
 }
 else {
  return false;
 }
}
```
### Step 3: Enable HTTPS

Secure your connections using HTTPS. This adds an extra layer of security by encrypting the data being sent to and from your server.

You can accomplish this with Nginx by adding the following to your server block:

```bash
server {
  listen 443 ssl;
  server_name your-domain.com;
  
  ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/certs/ssl-cert-snakeoil.pem;
  ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/private/ssl-cert-snakeoil.key;
}
```

### Step 4: Regularly Update & Audit Your System

To ensure the security of your system, it's important to constantly run security audits and update your system regularly. This could be achieved by using automated security testing tools such as OWASP ZAP, Nessus, etc.

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```
