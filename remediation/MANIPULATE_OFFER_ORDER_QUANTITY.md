## Remediation Steps for Manipulate Order Quantity for Products Under Offer

Manipulating order quantities for products under offer is a serious security issue that can lead to loss of income or overselling inventory. The following remediation steps can be followed to address this issue.

### Step 1: Validate User Input

Make sure that the quantity value the user inputs is valid. This will involve checking several conditions such as non-negative, non-decimal, and within a defined max limit. Below is a simple example using Python that shows how this validation can be achieved:

```python
def validate_quantity(quantity):
    max_quantity = 100
    if not quantity.isnumeric() or int(quantity) < 1 or int(quantity) > max_quantity:
        return False
    return True
```

### Step 2: Validate On The Server

Never trust the client with all the validation. Always double check on server side to ensure the data is not tampered with in transit. Below is an example using Node.js:

```javascript
app.post("/checkout", function(req, res) {
    if (!validateQuantity(req.body.quantity)) {
        res.status(400).send("Invalid quantity");
        return;
    }
    // proceed with checkout
});
```

### Step 3: Update Your Database Safely

When updating quantities in the database, ensure you are safely updating by locking rows or using atomic transactions. This could be achieved using SQL:

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

UPDATE products SET quantity = quantity - :ordered_quantity 
WHERE product_id = :product_id AND quantity >= :ordered_quantity;

COMMIT;
```
