## Remediation Steps for XML External Entity (XXE) Test for Path Traversal

XML External Entity (XXE) attack is a type of attack against an application that parses XML input. This attack occurs when XML input containing a reference to an external entity is processed by a weakly configured XML parser. It can lead to a variety of attacks such as disclosure of internal files, denial of service, server side request forgery (SSRF), etc.

### Step 1: Disable DTDs (Document Type Definitions)

XML parsers should not be allowed to parse DTDs. Disabling DTDs also makes parsing XML documents faster.

#### Java example using DocumentBuilderFactory:

```java
DocumentBuilderFactory dbf = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();
dbf.setFeature("http://apache.org/xml/features/disallow-doctype-decl", true);
```

### Step 2: Disable External Entities and External Document Type Declarations

Developers should preferably disable external entities and external document type declarations to mitigate the vulnerability.

#### Java example using SAXParserFactory:

```java
SAXParserFactory spf = SAXParserFactory.newInstance();
spf.setFeature("http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities", false);
spf.setFeature("http://xml.org/sax/features/external-parameter-entities", false);
spf.setFeature("http://apache.org/xml/features/nonvalidating/load-external-dtd", false);
```

### Step 3: Update Xml Parser's Configuration

If disabling DTDs or External Entities is not possible, consider patching or upgrading the XML parser software to a version that allows secure configuration.
