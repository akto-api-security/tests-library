## Remediation Steps for BOLA: Turning JSON Param into Array of Params with Integer

Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA) vulnerabilities, specifically the issue of turning a JSON parameter into an array of parameters with integer, could potentially lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data.

This could happen when input parameters received as a JSON object are parsed into an array, allowing for manipulation. An attacker could use a valid ID, paired with additional array elements, to gain unauthorized access.

The following steps outline how to remediate this issue:

### Step 1: Validate Input Types

Make sure to validate user input and expect the correct types, in this case, to attack this vulnerability strictly check that the parameter is not an array. Here is an example in JavaScript with the Express.js framework:

```javascript
app.post('/api/data', function (req, res) {
  if (Array.isArray(req.body.id)) {
    return res.status(400).send('Invalid request');
  }
  
  // process the request
});
```

### Step 2: Use Strict Authorization Checks

Each API end-point where possible should perform checks to ensure the authenticated user has the necessary permissions to access or modify the requested resource.

### Step 3: Implement Proper Error Handling

Implement proper error handling so that the application doesn't reveal sensitive information in error messages to the client.
