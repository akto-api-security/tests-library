## Remediation Steps for Ray AI Compute Engine Directory Traversal

Ray AI Compute Engine Directory Traversal is an issue where an attacker can gain access to any file or directory on your server. The key to prevent this vulnerability is to sanitize user input and define regulations for file and directory access in your codebase.

If directory traversal is detected, follow these steps to fix the issue:

### Step 1: Sanitize User Input

Sanitize any user-provided path input, by blocking entries like `..` which can navigate back through the directory tree. This is typically done in the function handling file and directory requests in your code.

```python
# Example in Python
import os

def safe_join(directory, filename):
    safe_path = os.path.join(directory, filename)
    safe_path = os.path.normpath(safe_path)

    if not safe_path.startswith(directory):
        # Potential directory traversal attempt
        return None

    return safe_path
```

### Step 2: Apply Access Controls

Define and enforce permissions, so that not all files and directories can be accessed. This can be done through filesystem permissions or within the code itself.

```bash
# Example in Bash
chmod 700 /target/directory
```

### Step 3: Implement Web Application Firewall (WAF)

Use a WAF that can detect directory traversal attempts and block them. This provides an extra layer of security besides code-based protections.

```bash
# Example: Install ModSecurity in Apache (Debian/Ubuntu)
sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-security2
sudo a2enmod security2
```
