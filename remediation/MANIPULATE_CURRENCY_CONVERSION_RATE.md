## Remediation Steps for Manipulation of Currency Conversion Rate

Manipulation of currency conversion rates could allow malicious users to exploit the system and make illegitimate profits. Here are steps on how to fix this vulnerability.

### Step 1: User Input Validation
Ensure that every user input is validated. This includes but is not limited to the source and target currencies, and the amount to be converted.

```python
def validate_input(source_currency, target_currency, amount):
    # Add validation code here
    pass
```

### Step 2: Implement a trusted currency exchange rate API
Instead of letting the client supply the exchange rate, your server should fetch this data from a trusted source and use it to calculate the conversion. 

```python
import requests

def get_exchange_rate(base_currency, target_currency):
    response = requests.get(f"https://api.exchangerate-api.com/v4/latest/{base_currency}")
    rates = response.json()['rates']
    return rates.get(target_currency, None)
```

### Step 3: Secure API Keys
Ensure that API keys to your currency conversion service are secured and not exposed in the client-side code. You could use environment variables to store these keys.

```bash
export API_KEY=your_api_key
```


### Step 4: Server-Side Rate Limiting
Implement rate limiting to prevent abusive or excessively high-frequency requests to your currency conversion API.

```python
from flask_limiter import Limiter

limiter = Limiter(key_func=get_remote_address)
@app.route('/convert', methods=['POST'])
@limiter.limit("10/minute")  # 10 requests per minute
def convert_currency():
    # Conversion code here
```
