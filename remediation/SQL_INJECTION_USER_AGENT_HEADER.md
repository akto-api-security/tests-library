# Remediation for SQL_INJECTION_USER_AGENT_HEADER

## Remediation Steps for SQL Injection on User Agent Header

SQL Injection on User Agent Header is a significant security concern which could provide an attacker with unauthorized access to sensitive data or even allow them to execute commands on the underlying database. It is thus crucial that input such as the User Agent Header is properly sanitized to prevent this kind of attack.

### Step 1: Input Validation
Implement validation to accept only a predefined set of User Agents.
Here's how you might do this in Python using the httpagentparser module:

```python
import httpagentparser
def validate_user_agent(user_agent):
    parsed_user_agent = httpagentparser.detect(user_agent)
    allowed_user_agents = ['Chrome', 'Firefox', 'Safari']
    if parsed_user_agent['browser']['name'] in allowed_user_agents:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

### Step 2: Parameterized Queries
Never concatenate strings to form SQL statements. Using parameterized queries will ensure that input is always treated as literal data and not part of the SQL command.

Here is an example in Python using the psycopg2 database adapter for PostgreSQL:

```python
import psycopg2

def safe_query(user_agent):
    conn = psycopg2.connect(database="testdb", user="postgres", password="password", host="localhost", port="5432")
    cur = conn.cursor()
    cur.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE user_agent = %s", (user_agent,))
    rows = cur.fetchall()
    return rows
```

### Step 3: Least Privilege Principle
Ensure that the database user used in the application does not have more privileges than necessary so that even if an attacker could inject SQL code, the potential damage would be limited.


### Step 4: Regularly Update and Patch
Reduce the attack surface by applying the most recent patches and updates to your database management system and any frameworks or libraries used in your application.
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
```

### Step 5: Use Web Application Firewalls
Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) can be used to sanitize input and output data in HTTP requests and responses, providing an additional layer of security against SQL Injection attacks.
```bash
sudo apt-get install modsecurity-crs
```
