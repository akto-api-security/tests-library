# Remediation for NODE_JS_SYS_INFO_RCE

## Remediation Steps for Node.JS System Information Library Remote Command Injection
Node.JS System Information Library Remote Command Injection is a severe security vulnerability. If not appropriately mitigated, an attacker can inject malicious commands remotely, potentially leading to privilege escalation or unauthorized system access.

### Step 1: Update System Information Library
Ensure you're using the latest version of the system information library. The developers often release patches for known security vulnerabilities.
```bash
npm install systeminformation --save
```

### Step 2: Validate Inputs
Avoid direct usage of user-supplied input within command-executing methods. Instead, ensure every piece of data passed to these methods is strictly validated to rule out unwanted commands or command-sequences. This can be done using an allow-list approach, where you only accept known good input.

```javascript
const VALID_COMMANDS = ['ls', 'cat', 'echo']; //just an example

function executeCommand(userCommand) {
    if (!VALID_COMMANDS.includes(userCommand)) {
      throw new Error('Invalid command');
    }
    //your command execution logic here
}
```

### Step 3: Use Parameterized Command APIs
Avoid using APIs that can execute arbitrary command strings like `child_process.exec()`. Switching to `child_process.execFile()` or `.spawn()` with the array variant will give you built-in shell metacharacter handling.

```javascript
const spawn = require('child_process').spawn;
let args = ['arg1', 'arg2'];
let child = spawn('command', args);
```

### Step 4: Code Reviews and Regular Updates
Carry out regular code reviews. Look out for usage of system and child process calls in the codebase, especially any which rely on untrusted input. Regularly updating your modules will also help mitigate future security threats.

Remember that remediation plans are a starting point and additional steps may be needed depending on your specific deployment, codebase, and other factors.
