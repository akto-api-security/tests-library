# Remediation for APACHE_HTTP_SERVER_XSS

## Remediation Steps for Apache HTTP Server Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a security vulnerability that attackers can use to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by users. It is a serious issue in Apache HTTP server that needs to be dealt with accordingly.

### Step 1: Update Apache Server

The first and foremost step is to update your Apache HTTP server to the latest version where known security vulnerabilities may have been fixed.

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install apache2
```

### Step 2: Filter Input Parameters

Make sure to filter and sanitize all the user inputs and HTTP query parameters. Preferably use a well-known library such as OWASP Java Encoder (for Java applications) to encode data output.

Example in Java:

```java
import org.owasp.encoder.Encode;
String safe = Encode.forHtml(untrustedInput);
```

### Step 3: Enable HttpOnly and Secure Cookie Flags

Setting the HttpOnly flag in cookies helps in mitigating the most common non-persistent XSS attacks. Similarly, the Secure flag will ensure the cookie is sent over HTTPS preventing man-in-the-middle attacks.

```java
Cookie cookie = new Cookie("user", "anonymous");
cookie.setHttpOnly(true);
cookie.setSecure(true);
response.addCookie(cookie);
```

### Step 4: Use Content Security Policy (CSP)

Implement CSP to prevent XSS attacks by disallowing inline scripts and external scripts from untrusted sources. Modify your .htaccess or Apache config with these headers.

```txt
Header set Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' trustedscripts.com;"
```

### Step 5: Regular Security Audit  

A regular security audit can help you find and resolve issues sooner. Use static analysis tools that are designed for detecting XSS vulnerabilities in your code. You should regularly update your Apache HTTP Server to utilize the most current security fixes and protocols offered by the Apache Software Foundation.

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install apache2
```

Remember to restart your Apache server after making these changes.

```bash
sudo service apache2 restart
```
