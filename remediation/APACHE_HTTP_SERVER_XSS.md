## Remediation Steps for Apache HTTP Server Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a security vulnerability that attackers can use to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by users. It is a serious issue in Apache HTTP server that needs to be dealt with accordingly.

### Step 1: Update Apache Server

The first and foremost step is to update your Apache HTTP server to the latest version where known security vulnerabilities may have been fixed.

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install apache2
```

### Step 2: Filter Input Parameters

Make sure to filter and sanitize all the user inputs and HTTP query parameters. Preferably use a well-known library such as OWASP Java Encoder (for Java applications) to encode data output.

Example in Java:

```java
import org.owasp.encoder.Encode;
String safe = Encode.forHtml(untrustedInput);
```

### Step 3: Enable HttpOnly and Secure Cookie Flags

Setting the HttpOnly flag in cookies helps in mitigating the most common non-persistent XSS attacks. Similarly, the Secure flag will ensure the cookie is sent over HTTPS preventing man-in-the-middle attacks.

```java
Cookie cookie = new Cookie("user", "anonymous");
cookie.setHttpOnly(true);
cookie.setSecure(true);
response.addCookie(cookie);
```

### Step 4: Use Content Security Policy (CSP)

Implement CSP to prevent XSS attacks by disallowing inline scripts and external scripts from untrusted sources. Modify your .htaccess or Apache config with these headers.

```txt
Header set Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' trustedscripts.com;"
```
