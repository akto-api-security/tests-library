## Remediation Steps for Parameter Manipulation by Boundary Values in Coupon and Discount Codes
Manipulation of coupon or discount codes is a vulnerability that can lead to severe financial impact on applications. This is usually achieved by manipulating the boundary values and exploiting the weakness in the application's logic. To mitigate against this vulnerability, proper validation checks must be put in place.

### Step 1: Implementing Input Validation
Implement input validation on the server side to ensure that the coupon or discount code meets the business requirements.

```Javascript
function isValidCouponCode(code) {
    const codeFormat = /^COUPON_[0-9]{4}$/;
    return codeFormat.test(code);
}
```

### Step 2: Boundary Value Check
Ensure that the coupon or discount code does not exceed the maximum allowed discount or the minimum purchase for the coupon to be active.

```Python
def is_valid_discount(code_discount_value, min_purchase, max_discount):
    if (code_discount_value > max_discount) or (code_discount_value < min_purchase):
        return False
    return True
```
### Step 3: Ensure Uniqueness of Coupon Codes
Maintain a registry of all the issued coupon and discount codes to ensure that each code is unique and can only be used once.
```php
function validate_unique_code($code) {
    $all_codes = get_all_codes();  // Function should return all active codes from database
    if (in_array($code, $all_codes)) {
        return false;
    }
    return true;
}
```

### Step 4: Limit the Number of Attempted Uses
Consider a restriction on the number of times a user can attempt to apply a discount or coupon code. This limits the effectiveness of brute force attacks.

```java
public boolean isExceedingMaxAttempts(int userId) {
    final int MAX_ATTEMPTS = 5;
    int attempts = getAttemptedByUser(userId); // Function should return number of attempts by a user
    return attempts >= MAX_ATTEMPTS;
}
```
