## Remediation Steps for Overreliance on LLMs and Generation of Anti-Malware with x86-64 Assembly Code

Overreliance on Low-Level Modules (LLMs) can increase the risk of vulnerabilities when generating anti-malware. Assembly x86-64 code can be a powerful tool in creating fast and efficient code for anti-malware software, but it must be used with caution to prevent security issues.

### Step 1: Minimize the use of Assembly Code 

Assembly code is powerful but can easily lead to hard-to-detect vulnerabilities. Where possible, use a higher-level language that offers better security, debugging, and readability features. 

```C
// Alternative in C
#include<stdio.h>
// Code goes here
```

### Step 2: Implement Correct Error Checking and Exception Handling

Failing to do so can result in uncontrolled behaviour which can be exploited by an attacker.

 ```C
// Example in C language
#include <stdio.h>
if (fopen("file.txt", "r") == NULL) {
    // appropriate error handling code
    printf("Error opening file!\n");
    return 1;
}
```

### Step 3: Avoid Direct Calls to Machine Language Programs
Especially from public-facing or less-secured systems. If necessary, use API or wrapper to limit their reach and control.

```C
// Example in C language
#include <stdio.h>
// Appropriate function call 
```

### Step 4: Regular Code Review and Update
Perform regular code audits to find and patch potential vulnerabilities.

```bash
# Use GIT for code version control
git pull origin master
```

### Step 5: Apply Principle of Least Privilege 

Ensure your systems and applications are running with the minimum privileges necessary to accomplish their tasks.

```bash
# Example in Bash
sudo -u limited_privilege_user command
```

### Step 6: Use Proven Anti-Malware Development Strategies 

Use strategies and tools that have been vetted and proven effective in the field of anti-malware software development.

```bash
# Use reputed tools and strategies
# Your tool command here
``` 

Use these steps to secure your usage of Low-Level Modules and the Generation of Anti-Malware with x86-64 Assembly Code.
