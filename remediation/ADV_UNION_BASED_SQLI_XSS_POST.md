# Remediation for ADV_UNION_BASED_SQLI_XSS_POST

## Remediation Steps for Advanced Union Based SQL Injection Attacks with XSS for POST method APIs 

Advanced Union Based SQL injection attacks with XSS for POST method APIs can be mitigated with a few security best practices. Here's how you can prevent such attacks:

### Step 1: Use Parameterized Queries or Prepared Statements

Using parameterized queries or prepared statements is one of the most effective ways to prevent SQL injection attacks. This method ensures that user input is always handled as literal value and not as a part of SQL command.

```java
String sql = "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE name = ? ";
PreparedStatement preparedStatement = connection.prepareStatement(sql);
preparedStatement.setString(1, username);
ResultSet resultSet = preparedStatement.executeQuery();
```

### Step 2: Input Validation

Ensure that all user inputs are checked and filtered, accepting only what’s necessary and expected.
```java
if (userInput.matches("[a-zA-Z ]+")) { 
    // Process valid input 
} else { 
    // Handle invalid input
}
```

### Step 3: Use HTTP Content-Security-Policy Header

Setting up a strong Content-Security-Policy HTTP response header can help prevent Cross-Site Scripting attacks by allowing you to control where resources should be allowed to load from.

```bash
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self';
```

### Step 4: Output Encoding or Escaping 

Ensure that data returned to user is trusted and safe. Use a trusted library to encode the output.
```java
String safeOutput = ESAPI.encoder().encodeForHTML(unsafeOutput);
```

### Step 5: Regular Audit and Update

Regularly performing code review, security testing and updating your application’s dependencies can ensure its safety.

These steps, when see as a whole, can greatly enhance the security of APIs against Advanced Union Based SQL Injection Attacks with an XSS exploit for the POST method APIs. Remember, security is not a one time activity but a continuous one.
