# Remediation for BOLA_COOKIE_FUZZING_DELETE

## Remediation Steps for Fuzzing Cookie Data: Exploiting BOLA for Unauthorized Access for DELETE method APIs

Exploitting BOLA (Broken Object Level Authorization) through fuzzing cookie data can lead to unauthorized access, particularly with DELETE method APIs. To prevent such scenarios, developers must ensure that APIs can validate and correctly handle cookie data, and that authorization is verified appropriately before any deletion activity.

Here are the steps to remediate this kind of vulnerability:

### Step 1: Validate Cookie Data

Ensure that your application appropriately validates the cookie data. Don't trust user inputs blindly. Input validation can be achieved by using a list of accepted inputs or by validating the structure of the input.

```java
import java.util.regex.Pattern;
 
Public boolean validCookie(String cookie) {
  String cookieRegex = "^[a-zA-z0-9]+$";
  Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile(cookieRegex);
  return pattern.matcher(cookie).matches();
}
```

### Step 2: Authorization Check

Before performing any deletion activity, verify if the user has the necessary permissions. RBAC (Role Based Access Control) can be used to determine if a user is authorized to perform specific actions.

```java
public boolean isUserAuthorized(User user) {
  Role userRole = user.getRole();
  // Assume isAdmin() is a method of Role object which returns true if the user is an Admin
  return userRole.isAdmin();
}
```

### Step 3: Handling Cookie Data in DELETE API

Now when DELETE API is called, first validate the cookie data and then check for authorization before deleting anything. 

```java
@RequestMapping(value = "/delete", method = RequestMethod.DELETE)
public ResponseEntity<?> deleteData(@CookieValue("user") String userCookie, @PathVariable("id") String id) {
 
  if(!validCookie(userCookie)){
    return new ResponseEntity<>(HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST);
  }
 
  User user = userService.getUserFromCookie(userCookie);
 
  if(!isUserAuthorized(user)){
    return new ResponseEntity<>(HttpStatus.UNAUTHORIZED);
  }
  
  // If passed both checks, proceed with deletion here
  
}
```

### Step 4: Regular Code Review and Update

Regular source code reviews can help spot potential security vulnerabilities early in the development life cycle. Ensure that your team follows a strict development methodology that incorporates security practices. Automated tools can be used for source code analysis. Update your code regularly to address any new security threats. 

Remember to avoid any unnecessary exposure of sensitive information in your codebase and to keep your secrets (API keys, passwords, etc.) secure.
