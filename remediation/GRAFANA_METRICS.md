# Remediation for GRAFANA_METRICS

## Remediation Steps for Exposed Grafana Metrics
Exposed Grafana metrics can be a major security concern as these metrics could contain sensitive data that should be kept confidential. 

### Step 1: Authentication Enablement
To prevent unauthorized access to your Grafana metrics, you should enable authentication. 

```python
from grafana_api.grafana_face import GrafanaFace

grafana_api = GrafanaFace(auth='YOUR_GRAFANA_API_KEY', host='localhost:3000')
grafana_api.auth.enable()

```

### Step 2: User Access Control
Only authenticated users should be able to access Grafana metrics. Assign specific roles and permissions to each user.

```python
grafana_api.user.add_user_to_org_role("UserId", "OrgId", "Role")
```

### Step 3: Data Source Permissions
To control the data that can be accessed by each user or team, implement data source permissions. 

```python
grafana_api.folder_permission.update_folder_permissions('FolderUID', [
    {
        "role": "Viewer",
        "permission": 0
    }
])
```

### Step 4: Closing Unused Ports
Close the unused ports to prevent unauthorized data access.

```bash
sudo ufw deny from any to any port 3000
```

### Step 5: Regular Audit and Update
Continuously monitor the access to your Grafana metrics to detect any suspicious activity. 

```bash
grafana_api.admin.stats()
```

Always make sure your Grafana version is up-to-date to protect against any known security vulnerabilities. 

```bash
sudo apt-get install --only-upgrade grafana
```
Keep in mind that, while these steps can significantly improve the security of your Grafana metrics, they don't provide complete protection against all types of attacks. A comprehensive security approach that covers all aspects of your system is always recommended.
