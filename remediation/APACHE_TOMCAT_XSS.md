## Remediation Steps for Apache Tomcat Cross-Site Scripting

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Apache Tomcat can allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into webpages viewed by other users. Such vulnerabilities should be addressed promptly to maintain the security and integrity of your application. Here are the steps to remediate this issue:

### Step 1: Upgrade to a Non-Vulnerable Version
The first remediation step is to upgrade your Apache Tomcat to a version that resolves this security issue. To do this use the following commands:

```bash
# Stop current Apache Tomcat service
sudo service tomcat7 stop

# Backup current Apache Tomcat
sudo mv /usr/share/tomcat7 /usr/share/tomcat7.bak

# Download and extract latest Apache Tomcat version (replace xxx with the latest version number)
wget http://mirror.ox.ac.uk/sites/rsync.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-7/vxxx/bin/apache-tomcat-xxx.tar.gz
tar xvzf apache-tomcat-xxx.tar.gz
mv apache-tomcat-xxx /usr/share/tomcat7

# Start new Apache Tomcat service
sudo service tomcat7 start
```

### Step 2: Implement Input Validation and Output Encoding
Next, it is important to ensure input validation and output encoding in the web application to prevent malicious scripts from executing. For a Java web application you can use the ESAPI library to encode output. 

Example in Java:

```java
// Import ESAPI classes
import org.owasp.esapi.ESAPI;
import org.owasp.esapi.Encoder;

// Create an encoder object
Encoder encoder=ESAPI.encoder();
String safeOutput = encoder.encodeForHTML(unsafeInput);
```

### Step 3: Configure and Enable the Security Manager
Apache Tomcat has a security manager that when enabled, makes it harder for malicious code to execute. 

To enable it, uncomment the security manager block in your `conf/server.xml`
```xml
<SecurityManager/>
```
