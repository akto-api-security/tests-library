# Remediation for REPLACE_AUTH_TOKEN_PATCH

## Remediation Steps for Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA) vulnerabilities

Broken Object Level Authorization can be detrimental to a secure application, allowing malicious agents to bypass authorizations and modify data they should not access. 

### Step 1: Authorization Verification Middleware

Firstly, adding an authorisation check middleware inside the logic of the function handler will be beneficial. This middleware will ensure that only authenticated users can access sensitive data or perform actions. An example in Node.js using express.js could look something like this:

```javascript
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  if (!req.user || req.user.role != "authorized") {
    res.status(403).send("Unauthorized");
    return;
  }
  next();
});
```

### Step 2: Access Rights on Routes

Ensure that authorization is being checked on individual routes. Use a framework built-in method or a custom middleware function to check if the user has the correct permissions. Below is an example on how to do this with Express.js:

```javascript
app.patch("/api/user/:id", checkAuth, (req, res) => {
  if(req.user.token != req.params.token){
      return res.status(403).send("Forbidden");
  }
  updateUser(req, res);
});
```
In the above, checkAuth is a middleware function checking if a user is authenticated.

### Step 3: Check Object Ownership

Whenever a PATCH method is called, verify if the user making the request is the owner of the object they are trying to modify:
```javascript
app.patch('/api/user/:id', checkAuth, (req, res) => {
  const userId = req.params.id;
  const userData = req.body;

  if (req.user.id !== userId) {
    return res.status(403).send('Forbidden');
    return;
  }

  User.findByIdAndUpdate(userId, userData)
    .then(() => res.status(200).send('User updated successfully'))
    .catch(err => res.status(500).send(err.message));
});
```
In this example, the user ID from the token is compared to the ID from the requested route. If they do not match, the server responds with a 'Forbidden' status. 

Remember, these are only examples, and actual implementation will depend on your specific use case and tech stack.
