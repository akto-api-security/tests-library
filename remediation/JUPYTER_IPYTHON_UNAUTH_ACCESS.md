# Remediation for JUPYTER_IPYTHON_UNAUTH_ACCESS

## Remediation Steps for Jupyter ipython Authorization Bypass

Jupyter ipython Authorization Bypass is a severe security vulnerability. If not properly addressed, attackers might gain unauthorized access, tamper with scripts, and even potentially run arbitrary commands.

### Step 1: Update the Jupyter Package
Most importantly, make sure to update your version of Jupyter to the most recent stable release. If the vulnerability is a known one, it is likely that a patch has been provided in newer versions.

```bash
pip install --upgrade jupyter
```

### Step 2: Configure the Jupyter Server
Set a strong password for your Jupyter server. Avoid using the default or easily guessable passwords. Here is a way to set up a password as jupyter server allows it:

```python
from notebook.auth import passwd
passwd()
```
This will ask for a password and will provide you a token which you can use in your configuration file (`jupyter_notebook_config.py`)

```python
c.NotebookApp.password = u'sha1:... the hash that was returned by passwd() function ...'
```

### Step 3: Enable Firewall 
Allow only trusted IPs to access Jupyter notebooks. Change firewall settings accordingly or use a virtual private network (VPN).

```bash
sudo ufw enable
sudo ufw allow from trusted_IP_address to any port jupyter_port
```

_Replace `trusted_IP_address` with your IP address and `jupyter_port` with the port your Jupyter server is running on._
