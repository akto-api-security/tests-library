# Remediation for OBFUSCATION_LLM

## Remediation Steps for Obfuscation Test on LLMs (Low-Level Microservices)
Obfuscation tests on LLMs are executed to verify the level of security in handling data. If not properly conducted, this might lead to serious vulnerability issues such as unauthorized access to sensitive data.

### Step 1: Implement Obfuscation
The idea is to hide the real code and make it difficult to understand, thereby reducing the likelihood of malicious attacks. An efficient way of doing this is by using a proven data obfuscator in your preferred programming language. Here's an example using Javascript.

```javascript
var jsobfuscator = require('javascript-obfuscator');

var obfuscatedCode = jsobfuscator.obfuscate(
    'Your sensitive JS code here',
    {
        compact: true,
        controlFlowFlattening: true
    }
);
```

### Step 2: Test after Obfuscation
Obfuscation testing is important to verify that the application is working as desired even after the code has been obfuscated.

```bash
sudo service yourService restart   // replace 'yourService' with your application or service name
```

### Step 3: Implement a Secure Coding Practice
Follow best security practices while coding, such as:

* Regularly updating libraries
* Avoiding use of deprecated libraries
* Using strong and unique credentials
* Avoiding hard-coding of sensitive information

```bash
npm outdated   // This command will check if your npm packages need to be updated
npm update     // Update your npm packages
```
