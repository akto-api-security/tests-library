# Remediation for SENSITIVE_DATA_EXPOSURE_ADDRESS

## Remediation Steps for Sensitive Data Exposure for Address

Sensitive data exposure for Address is a critical security flaw that can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive user information. Below are the remediation steps to address this issue:

### Step 1: Secure Data in Transit
Enable HTTPS for communication. This ensures that the data being transmitted between your server and the user's browser is in encrypted form and cannot be deciphered easily. Here's how to enable HTTPS using Node.js and Express.js.

```javascript
var fs = require('fs');
var https = require('https');
var express = require('express');
var app = express();

var options = {
  key: fs.readFileSync('test/fixtures/keys/agent2-key.pem'),
  cert: fs.readFileSync('test/fixtures/keys/agent2-cert.pem')
};

app.get('/', function (req, res) {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});

https.createServer(options, app).listen(3000);
```

### Step 2: Remove Sensitive Data from Logging
Ensure that any logging utilities in use do not record sensitive data. Here is an example of how to do this in Python with the logging module.

```python
import logging

def custom_func(record):
    record.msg = record.msg.replace('ADDRESS', 'REDACTED')
    return True

logging.getLogger().addFilter(custom_func)
```

### Step 3: Obscure the Sensitive Data in the Database
Replace the actual addresses with hashed versions of them.

Here's an example using Python's `hashlib`.

```python
import hashlib

def hash_address(address):
    return hashlib.sha256(address.encode()).hexdigest()  # Use a secure hash function

# use this to save address in the database
hashed_address = hash_address(actual_address)
```

### Step 4: Regularly Update the System
Often, patches and updates are released to cure known weaknesses. Make sure to keep every part of your system (OS, Web Server, Database, applications, plugins) up-to-date. This step would not involve writing code but would rather be handled by your security and DevOps team.
