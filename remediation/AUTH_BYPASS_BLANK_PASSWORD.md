## Remediation Steps for Authentication Bypass with Blank Password
Authentication bypass issues occur when system vulnerabilities allow unauthorized users to gain system access without providing valid authentication credentials. The following remediation steps outline how to prevent an 'Authentication Bypass with Blank Password' issue.

### Step 1: Implement a mandatory password policy
Ensure that your system rejects any blank passwords. Here is a simple code check that can be implemented in JavaScript.

```javascript
function validateForm() {
    var password = document.getElementById('password').value;
    
    if (password == "") {
        alert("Password must be filled out");
        return false;
    }
    //other form validations
}
```

### Step 2: Include password strength validation
The system should also validate that the password meets your defined password policy, for example, a minimum length or complexity. You can use the following Java code as an example of such validation.

```java
public boolean isValidPassword(String password) {

    if (password == null || password.length() < 8) {
      return false;
    }

    int charCount = 0;
    int numCount = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < password.length(); i++) {

        char ch = password.charAt(i);

        if (isNumeric(ch)) numCount++;
        else if (isLetter(ch)) charCount++;
        else return false;
    }

    return (charCount >= 2 && numCount >= 2);
}
```

### Step 3: Implement 2-factor authentication
Two-factor authentication is a secondary layer of security that uses something the user knows (password) and something the user has (email, phone number for OTP). Implementing this reduces the risk of successful brute force attacks.
