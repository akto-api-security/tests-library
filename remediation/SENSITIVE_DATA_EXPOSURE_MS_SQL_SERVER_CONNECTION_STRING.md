# Remediation for SENSITIVE_DATA_EXPOSURE_MS_SQL_SERVER_CONNECTION_STRING

## Remediation Steps for MS SQL Server Connection String Sensitive Data Exposure
Sensitive data exposure for MS SQL Server connection strings can lead to unwanted access to your database resulting in data leakages and potential dangers to the integrity of your data. Here's how you can mitigate it.
### Step 1: Use Integrated Security
Rather than supplying a username and password within the connection string, using the integrated security approach can be more secure. This technique uses the account credentials of the executing process to authenticate with the database.

```csharp
string connectionString = "Server=myServerAddress;Database=myDataBase;Integrated Security=True;";
```
### Step 2: Secure Your Connection String
Do not store plaintext connection strings in your application code. Instead, store them in configuration files that can be encrypted or secured.

In .NET applications (Web.config or App.config):
```xml
<connectionStrings>
  <add name="myConnectionString" connectionString="Server=myServerAddress;Database=myDataBase;Integrated Security=True;" />
</connectionStrings>
```
### Step 3: Utilize Encryption
MS SQL Server supports SSL encryption. Enable it to provide an extra layer of security to your data.

```csharp
string connectionString = "Server=myServerAddress;Database=myDataBase;Integrated Security=True;Encrypt=True;";
```
### Step 4: Regular Audit and Update
Always check for updates and patches from Microsoft for SQL Server which might include security enhancements. Also, making regular security audits ensures the security of your system. Regular password changes and removing stale accounts are essential as well. 

Avoid placing any sensitive information in your connection string that is unnecessary and make sure that any information within the connection string is absolutely necessary for the connection.

Maintaining a secure SQL Server environment is an ongoing process, which must continually adapt to new threats and new security practices. Hence, it's always recommended to follow the best security practices and guidelines provided by Microsoft.
