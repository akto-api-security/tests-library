## Remediation Steps for MS SQL Server Connection String Sensitive Data Exposure
Sensitive data exposure for MS SQL Server connection strings can lead to unwanted access to your database resulting in data leakages and potential dangers to the integrity of your data. Here's how you can mitigate it.
### Step 1: Use Integrated Security
Rather than supplying a username and password within the connection string, using the integrated security approach can be more secure. This technique uses the account credentials of the executing process to authenticate with the database.

```csharp
string connectionString = "Server=myServerAddress;Database=myDataBase;Integrated Security=True;";
```
### Step 2: Secure Your Connection String
Do not store plaintext connection strings in your application code. Instead, store them in configuration files that can be encrypted or secured.

In .NET applications (Web.config or App.config):
```xml
<connectionStrings>
  <add name="myConnectionString" connectionString="Server=myServerAddress;Database=myDataBase;Integrated Security=True;" />
</connectionStrings>
```
### Step 3: Utilize Encryption
MS SQL Server supports SSL encryption. Enable it to provide an extra layer of security to your data.

```csharp
string connectionString = "Server=myServerAddress;Database=myDataBase;Integrated Security=True;Encrypt=True;";
```
