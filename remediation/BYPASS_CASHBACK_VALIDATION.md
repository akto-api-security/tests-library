# Remediation for BYPASS_CASHBACK_VALIDATION

## Remediation Steps for Bypass Cashback Validation
Bypassing the cashback validation potentially allows attackers to exploit this vulnerability to manipulate the system and earn unauthorized cashbacks.

### Step 1: Validate Cashbacks at Server Side
Always validate on the server side regardless of the client-side validation status. Client validation can be useful for user-friendliness but never trust data from the client side without verification. 

```python
def validate_cashback(amount):
    if amount < 0:
        raise ValueError("Cashback amount cannot be negative.")
    elif amount > MAX_CASHBACK_AMOUNT:
        raise ValueError(f"Cashback amount exceeded maximum limit of {MAX_CASHBACK_AMOUNT}.")
```

### Step 2: Implement Limit Checks
Institute limit checks on the amount of cashback a user can receive in a day, week, or month. This will give you an extra layer of security, limiting potential losses from vulnerabilities or errors.

```python
def check_cashback_limit(user, amount):
    recent_cashbacks = get_recent_cashbacks(user)
    if sum(recent_cashbacks) + amount > CASHBACK_DAILY_LIMIT:
        raise ValueError("Daily limit on cash back exceeded.")
```
    
### Step 3: Apply Transaction Locks
Implement transaction locks to prevent two transactions happening at the same time with the same user and thus duplicating the cashback.

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
UPDATE users SET balance = balance + ? WHERE id = ?;
COMMIT;
```
