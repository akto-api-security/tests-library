## Remediation Steps for Command Injection in Ubuntu

Command injection is a security vulnerability that allows an attacker to inject and execute commands specified by the attacker in the vulnerable application. In the context of Ubuntu, this issue could allow an attacker to utilize system operations to compromise the system.

### Step 1: Validate User Input

Directly incorporating user inputs into command-line queries are a common source of command injection flaws. Always validate user inputs to ensure they conform to the expected format, using secure input functions.

```python
# Python Example
import re

def validate_input(user_input):
    # using regex to ensure input only contains alphanumeric and underscore
    return re.match(r'^\w+$', user_input) is not None
```

### Step 2: Avoid Using Shell=True in subprocess.run()

In Python, for example, avoid using `shell=True` in `subprocess.run()` or `os.system()`. Actively control what elements a command line is permitted to have.

```python
# Bad Practice - Vulnerable to Injection
import subprocess
subprocess.run('ls -l ' + user_input, shell=True)

# Good Practice 
subprocess.run(['ls', '-l', validated_user_input])
```

### Step 3: Use Parameterized Functions

Whenever possible, use language constructs that support parameterization, which can prevent command injection vulnerabilities.

```python
# PHP Example
$stmt = $pdo->prepare('SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ? AND status=?');
$stmt->execute([$email, $status]);
```
