# Remediation for LLM_MALWARE_COMPLETE_C

## Remediation Steps for Overreliance on LLMs
Overreliance on Loadable Linux Modules (LLMs) when generating full malware with C could pose serious security issues as this could make systems susceptible to malicious modules and rootkits. Appropriate measures should be taken to secure against this vulnerability.

### Step 1: Implement Regular System Audits
It is good practice to perform regular system audits to detect any suspicious activity. This can be done automatically via Auditd, a user space utility that captures audit data from the kernel.

```bash
sudo apt-get install auditd
sudo service auditd start
```
### Step 2: Secure C Code and Limit Usage of LLMs
To protect against malicious LLMs, it is advisable to restrict the use of modules where possible. Additionally, secure your C code against vulnerabilities by implementing best practices such as input validation, avoiding insecure code constructs etc.

```C
#include<stdio.h>
int main() {
   // Secure coding practices go here
}
```
### Step 3: Integrity Checking
Use tools like AIDE (Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment) to regularly analyze the integrity of your file system and check for unauthorized changes.

```bash
sudo apt-get install aide
aideinit
```
