## Remediation Steps for Node.js Express NODE_ENV Development Mode Enabled Test

Enabling Node.js Express development mode in a production environment is a significant security risk as it exposes detailed error messages, which can be exploited by attackers to gain further insight into your system. 

To mitigate this issue, follow the steps below:

### Step 1: Verify Your Current NODE_ENV Setting

Checking your current NODE_ENV setting will verify if your environment is currently in development mode. This can be done with the following command in your terminal:

```javascript
console.log(process.env.NODE_ENV);
```

### Step 2: Set NODE_ENV to Production

To set the environment to production mode, you can use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
export NODE_ENV=production
```

### Step 3: Check Your New NODE_ENV Setting

To make sure the changes have taken effect, you can rerun the below command:

```javascript
console.log(process.env.NODE_ENV);
```
Ensure the output from the command is `production`.

### Step 4: Permanently Set NODE_ENV in Your Application 

To permanently change your environment to production, you should set NODE_ENV in your application code. Below is an example of how to do this in Node.js:

```javascript
process.env.NODE_ENV = 'production';
```

### Step 5: Restart Your Application

After making these changes, please restart your application for the changes to take effect.

Please note that it is not a good practice to directly manipulate `process.env.NODE_ENV` in application code. It is suggested to use environment variables to set `NODE_ENV`.
