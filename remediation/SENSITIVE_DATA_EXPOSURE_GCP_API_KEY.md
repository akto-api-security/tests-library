## Remediation Steps for GCP API Key Exposure

Sensitive data exposure of GCP API Key can lead to serious security issues. If exposed, it allows unauthorized individuals to access and interact with the resources and services of Google Cloud Platform that can lead to data breaches and other potential harms. Here are the steps to remediate the situation:

### Step 1: Remove GCP API Key from public code repositories

If your GCP API Key has been exposed via a public code repository (like GitHub), the first step would be to remove that key from your public code.

```bash
# Use git to remove the file with the leaked API key
git rm --cached file-with-the-API-key
```

After removing the file, you should add it to your `.gitignore` file to avoid accidentally committing it again.

```bash
# Add the file to .gitignore
echo "file-with-the-API-key" >> .gitignore
```

### Step 2: Deactivate the Exposed GCP API Key

Deactivating the exposed API keys stops it from being misused.

Navigate to the Google Cloud Platform Console > APIs & Services > Credentials > Choose  the API key you've exposed > Click on "Delete"

### Step 3: Create a new GCP API Key 

Create a new API key to replace the older, exposed one.

Go To APIs & Services > Credentials > Create Credentials > API key.

### Step 4: Store GCP API Keys Securely 

Secure the way you use and store GCP API Keys, use environmental variables and key management services.

```python
# Python example - Load the GCP API Key from an environment variable
import os
gcp_api_key = os.environ.get('GCP_API_KEY')
```


### Step 5: Apply Principle of Least Privilege

Apply the principle of least privilege by restricting the permissions associated with your API credentials. This can help limit any potential damage should your GCP API keys become exposed. Only grant permissions that are absolutely necessary.
