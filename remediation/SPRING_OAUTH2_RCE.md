# Remediation for SPRING_OAUTH2_RCE

## Remediation Steps for Spring Security OAuth2 Remote Command Execution

The Spring Security OAuth2 Remote Command Execution vulnerability arises when the system is improperly validating redirect URIs. This means an attacker can execute remote commands due to the vulnerability present in the system. Implementing proper input validation and updating to a secure version of the framework can mitigate this issue.

### Step 1: Input Validation

Ensure that redirect URI used in your OAuth 2.0 configuration is validated properly. Implement pattern check for redirect URIs. Below is a sample Java code for validating redirect URI:

```java
public boolean isValidRedirectUri(String redirectUri) {
    try {
        URL url = new URL(redirectUri);
        if ("https".equals(url.getProtocol()) && "www.example.com".equals(url.getHost())) {
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    } catch (MalformedURLException e) {
        return false;
    }
}
```

### Step 2: Update to Secure Versions

Another remediation step is to update your OAuth2 and Spring Security to the latest stable versions that have fixed this vulnerability. 

```bash
# Use Spring Boot
<parent>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-parent</artifactId>
    <version>2.5.3</version>
    <relativePath/>
</parent>
# Update OAuth dependency
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-oauth2-client</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-oauth2-resource-server</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

### Step 3: Regular Update and Code Review

Performing regular updates and conducting code reviews following the best secure coding standards is an essential remediation step. Ideally, you should have the updates implemented as soon as they are released to mitigate the risk of this vulnerability.

```bash
mvn clean install
```

By following these remediation steps, you can effectively mitigate the Spring Security OAuth2 Remote Command Execution vulnerability. Always keep your systems and applications up-to-date with the latest software patches and updates. Implement best security practices when coding, especially when dealing with user inputs or third-party dependencies.
