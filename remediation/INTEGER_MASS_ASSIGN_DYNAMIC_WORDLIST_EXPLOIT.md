# Remediation for INTEGER_MASS_ASSIGN_DYNAMIC_WORDLIST_EXPLOIT

## Remediation Steps for Mass Assignment Vulnerability

Mass assignment vulnerability can be a serious issue. It allows an attacker to update all fields, including the ones that are supposed to be protected and thus, can have detrimental effects on the system.

This usually happens when a web application uses a function that takes user-supplied input and uses it to update a database record.

### Step 1: Identify the Issue

Firstly, examine your application's source code to identify the fields that are being mass assigned.

```python
class User(models.Model):
    username = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    password = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    isAdmin = models.BooleanField(default=False)
```

In the above example, the `isAdmin` field is vulnerable to mass assignment.

### Step 2: Properly Implement Input Validation and Whitelisting

The easiest way to prevent mass assignment vulnerabilities is to never assign parameters directly from user input. You can use whitelisting to only allow certain values to be mass assigned.

```python
public $fillable = ['username', 'password'];
```

In the above code snippet, only the `username` and `password` fields are whitelisted.

### Step 3: Use Specific Functions for Critical Updates

For critical updates, like changing user roles or statuses, don't rely on generic update functions. Instead, create functions that handle these specific updates.

```python
def makeAdmin(request, userId):
    user = User.objects.get(pk=userId)
    user.isAdmin = True
    user.save()
```

The above code only allows a user to be promoted to admin via a specific function, not via mass assignment.

### Step 4: Keep Reviewing Your Code

Always perform code reviews to ensure that no new fields are being exposed to mass assignment.

### Step 5: Regularly Update Your Dependencies

Outdated libraries can also contain mass assignment vulnerabilities. Therefore, always update your dependencies to the latest versions and use a software composition analysis tool to help identify any potential risks.

Remember, security is a continuous process and requires regular code audits, updates, and security awareness among your developers.
