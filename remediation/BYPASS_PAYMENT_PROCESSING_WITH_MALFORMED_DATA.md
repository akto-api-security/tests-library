## Remediation Steps for Bypass Payment Processing with Malformed Data

Bypassing payment processing with malformed data is a serious security issue. Attackers might send malformed data or manipulate the payloads to the server over the payment gateway, leading to unfair transactions or unauthorized financial activities.

### Step 1: Input validation
The simplest, most effective step you can take is to validate input. Validate the user input before processing it.

```java
public boolean isValidData(PaymentData data) {
  if (data == null || data.getCreditCardNumber().length() != 16 
      || data.getAmount() <= 0 
      || data.getExpiryDate().isBefore(LocalDate.now())) {
      return false; 
  }
  return true;
}
```

### Step 2: Use strong data types
Implement strong data types wherever it applies in the payment processing code. 

```java
public class PaymentData {
  private final CreditCardNumber creditCardNumber;
  private final CurrencyAmount amount;
  private final ExpiryDate expiryDate;
}
```

### Step 3: Apply encryption
Use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) / Transport Layer Security (TLS) for any interaction with your application that includes payment data.

```bash
openssl genrsa -out server.key 2048
openssl req -new -x509 -key server.key -out server.crt -days 365
```

### Step 4: Regular Update and Patching
Regularly update and patch the payment gateway systems and other associated software platforms to keep abreast of any new security updates or fixes.

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
```

### Step 5: Log transactions
Lastly, maintain transaction logs. They are extremely important for identifying fraudulent transactions and resolving disputes.

```java
private final Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(this.getClass());

public void processPayment(PaymentData paymentData) {
  if (isValidData(paymentData)) {
    log.info("Payment processed for {} with amount {}", paymentData.getCreditCardNumber(), paymentData.getAmount());
}
```
