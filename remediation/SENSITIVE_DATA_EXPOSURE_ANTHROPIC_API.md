## Remediation Steps for Sensitive Data Exposure for ANTHROPIC API

Sensitive Data Exposure is a well-known security issue. If we do not properly protect sensitive data, unauthorized users may gain access to it. The violation of data privacy could lead to serious problems, including fraud and identity theft.

### Step 1: Encrypt all API Data
Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in the transmission by utilizing modern encryption methods. Ensure all sensitive data is encrypted using SSL/TLS during transmission.

Here is an example of how to force SSL/TLS in a Python Django application:

```python
# In settings.py
SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT = True
SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER = ('HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO', 'https')
```
### Step 2: Implement Authorization Checks
Ensure that each API request is provided by an authenticated user who has authorization to use that particular data. 

```python
# Basic example in Python Flask
@app.route('/api/data')
def api_data():
    if not current_user.is_authenticated:
        return jsonify({'error': 'Not authorized'}), 401
    return jsonify(get_user_data(current_user))
```

### Step 3: Utilize Content Security Policy (CSP)
Implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) to prevent unauthorized inline code execution.

```python
# Django example
CSP_DEFAULT_SRC = ("'none'", )
CSP_STYLE_SRC = ("'self'", 'https://fonts.googleapis.com')
```
