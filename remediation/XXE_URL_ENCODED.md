# Remediation for XXE_URL_ENCODED

## Remediation Steps for XML External Entity (XXE) Vulnerability with URL Encoded Payload in API Endpoints
The XML External Entity vulnerability allows an attacker to cause Denial of Service or potentially access local or remote content and services. Here are the measures you can take to address this issue:

### Step 1: Disable XML External Entity Processing
In most cases, you don't need to process external XML entities. You can disable it in your XML reader's settings.
For example, if you are using Java with DOM:
```java
DocumentBuilderFactory dbf = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();
dbf.setExpandEntityReferences(false);
```
For Python's `lxml` library:
```python
from lxml import etree
parser = etree.XMLParser(resolve_entities=False)
```

### Step 2: Use a Less Complex Data Format
If you don't need XML's capabilities, you can consider switching to a less complex data format like JSON or CSV, which is free from this sort of attack.

### Step 3: Whitelist Server-Side Include (SSI) Directives
Instead of allowing any URL to be included, validate the inclusion against a list of trusted URLs.

### Step 4: Use Limitations and Timing Controls
Implement controls to block resource-intensive requests, or slow down the interactions to reduce the risk of Denial of Service attacks.
