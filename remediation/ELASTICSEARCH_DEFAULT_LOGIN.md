# Remediation for ELASTICSEARCH_DEFAULT_LOGIN

## Remediation Steps for ElasticSearch Default Login Vulnerability

ElasticSearch Default Login Vulnerability is a potential security threat as it poses a risk of unauthorized access to the ElasticSearch system. To mitigate this vulnerability, it's fundamental to implement proper authentication and authorization measures.

### Step 1: Enable Elasticsearch Security features
Elasticsearch comes with basic security features along with the free basic tier. Simply, set `xpack.security.enabled` to `true` in the `elasticsearch.yml` configuration file.

```yaml
xpack.security.enabled: true
```

### Step 2: Setup built-in users
Elasticsearch comes with built-in users. Run the setup passwords tool to set up the passwords for these users.

```bash
bin/elasticsearch-setup-passwords interactive
```
Follow the prompts to set new, unique, and strong passwords for each built-in user. 

### Step 3: Implement TLS/SSL
Another security measure is to use TLS/SSL to encrypt network communication. You need to set `xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled` to `true` in the `elasticsearch.yml` configuration file to enable it.

```yaml
xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled: true
```

Use Elasticsearch's internal tool Certutil to generate a certificate that can be used by Elasticsearch.

```bash
bin/elasticsearch-certutil ca
```

Then, point Elasticsearch to where your certificate and private key are located by adding these lines to your Elasticsearch configuration:

```yaml
xpack.security.transport.ssl.keystore.path: certs/elastic-certificates.p12
xpack.security.transport.ssl.truststore.path: certs/elastic-certificates.p12
```

### Step 4: Restart Elasticsearch
Finally, restart Elasticsearch to apply these changes:

```bash
sudo service elasticsearch restart
```

Remember to review Elasticsearch security settings regularly and promptly apply any security updates or patches released by Elasticsearch.
