## Remediation Steps for Kubernetes Kustomization Disclosure

Kubernetes Kustomization Disclosure is indeed a security issue. It involves the unintended exposure of Kustomization objects which can include secret tokens or credentials. Below, we present the steps to remediate this vulnerability.

### Step 1: Ensure All Secret Definitions Are Secure

It's crucial that secret definitions should be stored securely. This can be done using Kubernetes Secrets or other secret management tools.

```bash
kubectl create secret generic my-secret --from-literal=key1=supersecret
```

### Step 2: Avoid Using Kustomization for Sensitive Data

Don't embed sensitive data (like OAuth tokens, SSH keys, etc.) directly in Kustomization files. Use proper secret management practices like Kubernetes Secrets, HashiCorp Vault, etc.

```bash
# Instead of embedding secrets in Kustomization files,
# create a Kubernetes secret and refer to it
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: my-secret
type: Opaque
data:
  key1: c3VwZXJzZWNyZXQ=  # "supersecret" base64 encoded
```

```bash
# In your Kustomization or Deployment files, refer to the secret
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: secret-example-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: test-container
    image: k8s.gcr.io/busybox
    command: [ "/bin/sh", "-c", "env" ]
    env:
      - name: SECRET_KEY1
        valueFrom:
          secretKeyRef:
            name: my-secret
            key: key1
```


### Step 3: Use RBACs to Limit Access

Ensure you are implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for restricting who can get Kustomization details via the 'kubectl get' command.

```bash
# Example of Role that can only get and watch Pods
kind: Role
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  namespace: default
  name: pod-reader
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["pods"]
  verbs: ["get", "watch", "list"]
```

Remember to regularly review and update access controls as per the required level of user roles.
