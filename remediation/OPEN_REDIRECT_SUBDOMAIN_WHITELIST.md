# Remediation for OPEN_REDIRECT_SUBDOMAIN_WHITELIST

## Remediation Steps for Open Redirect Subdomain Whitelist

Open redirects represent a class of vulnerabilities that can trick victims into going to malicious sites when they believe they are visiting trusted ones. If you are using a whitelist to only allow certain subdomains, but that list can be exploited, you may be susceptible to this issue. Here's how to remediate it.

### Step 1: Identify vulnerable code

The root of this security issue often lies in the code that processes URLs or redirections. You must identify the scripts or methods that do this.

### Step 2: Validate the URLs

To prevent open redirect vulnerabilities, validate and sanitize all user-submitted URLs and make sure that they do not contain any redirection. Below is an example in PHP:

```php
function is_valid_url($url) {
    //parse the URL into its components
    $parts = parse_url($url);
    //check the host against your whitelist
    if (!in_array($parts['host'], array('allowed-subdomain.example.com', 'another-allowed-subdomain.example.com'))) {
        //the host is not on the whitelist
        return false;
    }
    return true;
}
```

### Step 3: Use safe Redirect methods

Several frameworks provide safe ways to handle URL redirections. In Django (Python), for instance, you can use HttpResponseRedirect. Here is an example:

```python
from django.http import HttpResponseRedirect
from django.urls import is_safe_url

def redirect_to_next(request):
    next_url = request.POST.get('next', request.GET.get('next'))
    if next_url and is_safe_url(url=next_url, allowed_hosts=request.get_host()):
        return HttpResponseRedirect(next_url)
    else:
        return HttpResponseRedirect('/default/url')
```

### Step 4: Test your application

Lastly, make sure to test your application after implementing those changes to ensure it behaves as expected and the vulnerability has been successfully fixed.

Remember, the code above is only an example and should be adapted to match your use case or application.
