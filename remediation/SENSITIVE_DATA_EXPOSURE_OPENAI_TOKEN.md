# Remediation for SENSITIVE_DATA_EXPOSURE_OPENAI_TOKEN

## Remediation Steps for Sensitive Data Exposure - OpenAI Token

Exposing sensitive data like OpenAI tokens can lead to unauthorized access and potential misuse. Use below remediation steps to prevent and mitigate this security issue.

### Step 1: Environment Variables

Instead of hardcoding sensitive data, use environment variables to store your sensitive information.

In Python, this can be done using the `os` module:

```python
import os
token = os.getenv('OPENAI_TOKEN')
```

And in Bash:

```bash
export OPENAI_TOKEN="your-openai-token"
```

### Step 2: Never Share Sensitive Data

Do not share your OpenAI Token with anyone, and avoid adding them in logs, reports or repositories.

### Step 3: Making Use of .gitignore file for Git Repository

If your project is in a Git repository, always add file(s) that contains sensitive data to the .gitignore file.

```bash
echo "file-with-credentials.txt" >> .gitignore
```

### Step 4: Immediate Token Revocation and Rotation

If you believe your OpenAI token has been exposed, immediately contact OpenAI for token revocation and get a new token.

### Step 5: RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)

Implement RBAC to restrict the level of access provided to different roles/users in your application.
