# Remediation for BOLA_ACCESS_SYS_RESOURCE

## Remediation Steps for File System Resource Retrieval: Exploiting BOLA through Direct Parameter Value Manipulation
File System Resource Retrieval, or Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA), is a serious security vulnerability which occurs when an API exposes endpoints allowing object identifiers to be manipulated directly. This could potentially result in unauthorized access.

### Step 1: Use Random or Hashed Values for Object IDs

In essence, don't use serial numeric IDs for your API where the ID can be altered to retrieve others resources. Use UUID or any forms of unique values. Here is a Python code snippet that generates UUID:

```python
import uuid

def get_unique_id():
    return str(uuid.uuid4())

print(get_unique_id())
```

### Step 2: Implement Proper Authorization Policies

Even when object identifiers are manipulated, the system should properly validate that the current user session has access to the requested resource. Consider the entire flow of the API and implement access control lists (ACLs) appropriately.

```python
def check_acl(user, resource):
    return user.has_permission_for(resource)

if check_acl(current_user, requested_resource):
    # process and return requested resource
else:
    # return permission denied error
```

### Step 3: Use Effective Input Validation Techniques

Handling user input should be done with caution. Applying filtering and encoding techniques can mitigate the effect of direct value manipulation. For example, in Python, again:

```python
from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/resource", methods=["GET"])
def get_resource():
    resource_id = request.args.get("id")
    if resource_id is not None:
        # validate that the id is properly formed and does not contain illegal characters
```
