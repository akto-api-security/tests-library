# Remediation for ERROR_BASED_SQLI_XSS

## Remediation Steps for Error based SQL Injection Test with XSS

Error-based SQL Injection Test with XSS is a type of security vulnerability that exposes sensitive database content by manipulating SQL queries via user inputs. Additionally, it leaves the application susceptible to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

### Step 1: Use Prepared Statements or Parameterized Queries

The number one remedy against SQL Injection is using prepared statements or parameterized queries. Nearly all modern programming languages and database management systems support them. 

For an example in Java,
```java
String selectSql = "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?";
PreparedStatement preparedStatement = connection.prepareStatement(selectSql);
preparedStatement.setString(1, username);
preparedStatement.setString(2, password);
ResultSet resultSet = preparedStatement.executeQuery();
```

### Step 2: Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF)

A WAF can help provide an additional layer of security. It can detect and filter out identified injection patterns which could lead to SQL injection or XSS attacks.

### Step 3: Data Sanitization 

Avoid using special characters in user input without proper sanitization. Special characters can include; brackets, commas, numerical operators, single or double quotes etc. 

In Java, using the `ESAPI.encoder().canonicalize()` method from OWASP's Enterprise Security API (ESAPI) project can be helpful.

```java
import org.owasp.esapi.ESAPI;

String safe = ESAPI.encoder().canonicalize(input);
```

### Step 4: Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)

To mitigate XSS attack, besides input validation and sanitization, you should also send CSP headers from the server which helps in reducing XSS by declaring what dynamic resources are allowed to load depending on the source.

A very basic example of such a policy in PHP would be:
```php
header("Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self';");
```
Please note, CSP is an advanced technique with a high level of complexity. It requires detailed understanding of a system for proper implementation.
