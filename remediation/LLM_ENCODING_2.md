# Remediation for LLM_ENCODING_2

## Remediation Steps for Prompt Injection with Encoding on LLMs - Base64 String with Names
Prompt Injection is a form of security vulnerability where an attacker can inject malicious code in an input field or prompt meant for user interaction. If the application handles Base64-encoded strings and names, this vulnerability may lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data.

### Step 1: Input Validation
Every user input should be considered untrusted and must be validated before processing. Special characters that have a specific meaning in the programming language should be either encoded or filtered out.

Here's an example of how to do this in Python:

```python
import re

def validate_input(input_string):
    # This function will only allow letters, numbers, and a few special characters: ., - and _
    pattern = re.compile(r'^[\w\.-]+$')
    if not pattern.match(input_string):
        raise ValueError('Invalid input, please do not use special characters.')
```

### Step 2: Handle Base64 Strings Safely
If the application has to handle Base64 strings with names, ensure that it decodes such strings in a secure manner and validates their content before usage.

```python
import base64

def decode_and_validate_base64(base64_string):
    try:
        decoded_string = base64.b64decode(base64_string).decode()
    except Exception as e:
        raise ValueError('Invalid Base64 input')
      
    return validate_input(decoded_string)
```

### Step 3: Use Parameterized Queries
Parameterized queries or prepared statements should be used to prevent code injection attacks.

Here's an example in Python using sqlite3:

```python
import sqlite3

def get_user(db_conn, user_id):
    cursor = db_conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id=?', (user_id,))
    return cursor.fetchall()
```
