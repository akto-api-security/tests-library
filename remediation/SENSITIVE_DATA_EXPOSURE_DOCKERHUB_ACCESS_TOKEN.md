# Remediation for SENSITIVE_DATA_EXPOSURE_DOCKERHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN

## Remediation Steps for DockerHub Access Token Exposure
Sensitive data exposure, like DockerHub access token, can lead to unauthorized access and activities in your DockerHub repository. To mitigate this security issue, please follow the steps below:

### Step 1: Revoke Compromised DockerHub Access Token
First, if you suspect your DockerHub access token is exposed, immediately revoke it. Use the DockerHub dashboard to invalidate the compromised token.

```bash
Login > Settings > Security > Delete Token
```
Unfortunately, DockerHub does not provide any API to perform this action in an automated manner.

### Step 2: Create New DockerHub Access Token
Create a new access token via the DockerHub dashboard or using the DockerHub HTTP API.
```bash
Login > Settings > Security > New Access Token
```
For DockerHub HTTP API:
```bash
curl -X POST https://hub.docker.com/v2/users/login/ -d 'username=YOUR_USERNAME&password=YOUR_PASSWORD'
```

### Step 3: Secure the New DockerHub Access Token
Always securely store the DockerHub access tokens, and never expose them in publicly accessible places like GitHub repositories. Use secret handling tools like Docker Secrets, AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault to securely manage your tokens.

### Step 4: Regular Rotation and Audit of Tokens
Regularly rotate your DockerHub access tokens and monitor their usage. Regular auditing and updating help in maintaining the secure posture of your systems.
