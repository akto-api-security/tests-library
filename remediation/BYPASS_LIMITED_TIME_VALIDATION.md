# Remediation for BYPASS_LIMITED_TIME_VALIDATION

## Remediation Steps for Bypass Limited Time Validation
Bypass limited time validation is a security vulnerability that involves an attacker circumventing time-bound limitations within a system. This could lead to unauthorized access or misuse of resources or privileges.

### Step 1: Parameterized Queries
One of the first ways to prevent time validation bypass is to use parameterized queries. This eliminates the chance of SQL Injection, which could be used to manipulate time-based queries.

```java
String query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username=? AND password=?";
PreparedStatement pst = con.prepareStatement(query);
pst.setString(1, username);
pst.setString(2, password);
ResultSet rs = pst.executeQuery();
```

### Step 2: Input Validation
Ensure you don't accept date/time as user input or from an untrusted client. Validate user inputs to ensure they don't contain malicious commands.

```ruby
validates_presence_of :username, :password
```

### Step 3: Use a Secure Time Source
Ensure to use a secure and reliable time source for checking the validity of time-bound resources.

```bash
sudo timedatectl set-ntp true
```

### Step 4: Encrypt the Data
Encrypt the data, especially if it is sensitive. This is critical as it protects it from being accessed or manipulated without authorization.

```python
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet
cipher_suite = Fernet(key)
cipher_text = cipher_suite.encrypt(data)
```

### Step 5: Regularly Review Code and Update
Carry out static code analysis, also have other team members peer review your code.

```bash
sonar-scanner
```
