## Remediation Steps for Improper Character Handling in Username

Improper character handling in a username can lead to security vulnerabilities such as SQL Injections, Cross Site Scripting (XSS), and more. To remediate this issue, it is important to validate, sanitize and encode all the inputs received from the user.

Here's an example of how to handle an input string in user's username using Java:

### Step 1: Add Username Formatting Guides
The application should enforce username formatting rules to avoid any unnecessary characters that may allow for exploits.

```java
public static boolean isUsernameValid(String username) {
    String regex = "^[a-zA-Z0-9._-]{3,}$";
    return username.matches(regex);
}
```
In this example, we permit only letters, numbers, periods, underscores, and dashes. This reduces the potential for introducing harmful characters.

### Step 2: Input Sanitization
Input sanitization is important to ensure any potentially harmful characters have been removed or escaped, this is to prevent SQL Injections and XSS.

```java
public static String sanitize(String input) {
    return StringEscapeUtils.escapeHtml(input);
}
```
This example uses Apache's `StringEscapeUtils` class to escape HTML entities which helps in preventing Cross-Site Scripting attacks.

### Step 3: Invoke the Utility Methods

```java
String username = userInput;
if(isUsernameValid(username)){
    username = sanitize(username);
} else{
    System.out.println("Invalid username provided");
}
```
Use these utility methods wherever the application is accepting the username input.
