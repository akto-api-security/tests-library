## Remediation Steps for Pyload Flask Config Unauthenticated Access
Access to the Flask server's configuration in PyLoad without authentication is a severe security vulnerability. This can give an attacker crucial system details that can be exploited. Here's how to remediate this issue.

### Step 1: Use Environment Variables for Critical Configurations
Instead of hardcoding configuration details (like database credentials) in your application, store them as environment variables. Flask (and many other platforms) allows fetching configuration from the environment variables.

```python
import os
app.config['SECRET_KEY'] = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY', 'default_value')
```
### Step 2: Flask Configuration Protection
Block access to application configuration from routes. Secure your Flask app by ensuring that the app's Configuration files are never returned in a response.

```python
@app.route('/config/')
def config():
  abort(404)
```
### Step 3: Always Set the Debug Mode to False in a Production Environment
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.debug = False
    app.run()
```
If debug mode is left on in a production environment, users would gain access to very detailed debugging pages on error, which can provide important details that can be exploited.

### Step 4: Regularly Update Flask version
Regularly updating Flask will ensure you have the latest security patches.

```bash
pip install --upgrade Flask
```
Also, regularly updating your codebase will make sure that any deprecated or insecure functionality isn't being used.

### Step 5: Employ Flask-Security or Flask-Login
These extensions simplify the process of adding user authentication in your Flask app, providing various features such as session management, user roles, and password hashing.

```bash
pip install Flask-Security
```
Then you can use it in your code as:
```python
from flask_security import Security, SQLAlchemyUserDatastore, \
    UserMixin, RoleMixin, login_required
```
