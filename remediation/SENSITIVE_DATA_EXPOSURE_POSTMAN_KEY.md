# Remediation for SENSITIVE_DATA_EXPOSURE_POSTMAN_KEY

## Remediation Steps for Sensitive Data Exposure: Postman Key

Sensitive data exposure, particularly of the Postman Key, can result in unauthorized access and potential misuse of your API services. The following steps can help you address this vulnerability and secure the Postman Key. 

### Step 1: Avoid Hard-Coding Postman Key

Avoid hard-coding the Postman Key within your source code. Instead, use environment configurations to store secrets.

```javascript
// Don't Do This
const postmanKey = "YOUR_POSTMAN_KEY";

// Do This
const postmanKey = process.env.POSTMAN_KEY;
```

### Step 2: Use .env Files for Development

For development purposes, store sensitive information in a `.env` local file. Never commit this file to source control.

```bash
# .env
POSTMAN_KEY=YOUR_POSTMAN_KEY
```

### Step 3: Use Secure Vault for Production

For production, use a secure vault or secure environment variables provided by your hosting service.

```sh
# for example on Heroku
heroku config:set POSTMAN_KEY=YOUR_POSTMAN_KEY
```

### Step 4: Restrict API Key Usage

Use the Postman Key only where it is necessary. Limit requests that use the key and monitor its usage.

```javascript
// Only use key when necessary
axios.get('https://example.com', {
  headers: {
    'X-API-key': postmanKey
  }
})
```

### Step 5: Regular Key Rotation
Schedule regular Postman Key rotation. This means assigning a new key at regular time intervals and revoking the old key.

```bash
# reaching to postman's API or dashboard and create a new key and revoke the old one
```

### Step 6: Responding to a Key Leak
In case of a leak, revoke the compromised key and issue a new one.

```bash
# reaching to postman's API or dashboard and create a new key and revoke the old one
```

Remember, prevention is always the best cure for sensitive data exposure. Therefore, always keep secrets secure and monitor their usage regularly to avoid any possible data breach or misuse.
