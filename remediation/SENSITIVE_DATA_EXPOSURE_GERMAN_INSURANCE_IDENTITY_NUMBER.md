# Remediation for SENSITIVE_DATA_EXPOSURE_GERMAN_INSURANCE_IDENTITY_NUMBER

## Remediation Steps for German Insurance Identity Number Sensitive Data Exposure
Sensitive data exposure is a serious issue. Without properly securing your data, particularly sensitive information like the German Insurance Identity Numbers, attackers may steal these details that may lead to fraud and identity theft. Here's the step by step remediation guide:

### Step 1: Data Encryption
This is the first and most critical step. Always encrypt sensitive information at rest and in transit. Here's an example using AES encryption in Python:

```python
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
import base64

def encrypt(plain_text, key):
   cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_ECB)
   encrypted_text = base64.b64encode(cipher.encrypt(plain_text))
   return encrypted_text
```

### Step 2: Secure Data Transfer
Always use secure connections (HTTPS, WSS) for data transfer. Do not transfer sensitive data over unsecured or public networks.

### Step 3: Use secure hashing for storing sensitive data
If required to store the German Insurance Identity Numbers, avoid storing them in plain text. Instead, use a secure hashing algorithm like SHA-256 or bcrypt (preferably with salt). Here's an example with SHA-256 in Python:

```python
import hashlib
def hash_data(data):
    digest = hashlib.sha256(data.encode()).hexdigest()
    return digest
```

### Step 4: Implement access control & principle of least privilege
Only authorized and authenticated users should be able to access the encrypted data.
