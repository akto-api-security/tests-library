## Remediation Steps for Cookie Misconfiguration
Cookie misconfiguration can lead to unauthorized access of user data, session hijacking and other serious security issues.

The following steps can help fix cookie misconfiguration in a secure manner:

### Step 1: Set HttpOnly flag
This prevents the cookie from being accessed through client-side scripts.

In PHP:
```php
setcookie('name', 'value', time()+3600, '/', 'domain.com', false, true);
```

### Step 2: Set Secure flag
Ensure that cookies are sent over HTTPS only.

In PHP:
```php
setcookie('name', 'value', time()+3600, '/', 'domain.com', true, false);
```

### Step 3: Set SameSite attribute
This attribute prevents the browser from sending the cookie along with cross-site requests.

In PHP, cookies can be made secure using:
```php
setcookie('name', 'value', ['samesite' => 'Strict']);
```

### Step 4: Set sensible Expiration Times
Shorter cookie lifetimes are generally better.

In PHP:
```php
setcookie('name', 'value', time()+600); // 10 minutes
```

### Step 5: Encrypt cookie values
To protect sensitive data present in the cookies, it is advisable to encrypt data before setting it in the cookie.

In PHP:
```php
$encrypted_value = openssl_encrypt('cookie_value', 'encryption_method', 'encryption_key');
setcookie('name', $encrypted_value, time()+3600);
```
