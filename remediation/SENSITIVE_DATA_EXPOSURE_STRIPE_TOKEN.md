## Remediation Steps for Stripe Token Data Exposure
Sensitive Stripe token data exposure is a critical security issue. If Stripe tokens are exposed, attackers may gain unauthorized access to sensitive payment information. To secure Stripe tokens, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Store Stripe Secret Key in Environment Variable
Rather than hardcoding your secret key into your application, consider storing it in an environment variable. This adds a layer of security, making it less likely for the key to be exposed. 

In Node.js, this might look something like:

```javascript
const stripe = require('stripe')(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY);
```

and in Python, similarly:

```python
import stripe
stripe.api_key = os.environ.get('STRIPE_SECRET_KEY')
```

### Step 2: Avoid Logging Sensitive Info
Ensure your application does not log sensitive info like the Stripe token. This reduces the chance of the token being leaked.

In JavaScript, be careful with console.log statements:
```javascript
// Bad
console.log(token);

// Good
console.log('Stripe token processed successfully.');
```
### Step 3: Use HTTPS, Not HTTP:
Make sure you are using HTTPS for transactions, not HTTP. HTTPS encrypts the communication between your server and the client's browser, protecting the information from being stolen in transit.

In Node.js, you can use the [https module](https://nodejs.org/api/https.html) to make secure requests.

```javascript
var https = require('https');
```
