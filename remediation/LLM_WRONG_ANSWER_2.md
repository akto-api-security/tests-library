# Remediation for LLM_WRONG_ANSWER_2

## Remediation Steps for Overreliance on LLMs Generating Wrong Answer for Prime Check
Overreliance on Low-Level Modules (LLMs) while generating prime check can introduce vulnerabilities in your code by providing incorrect results. Following is a way to mitigate this issue using Python:

### Step 1: Define a Proper Prime Checking Function
We need a correctly implemented function that can accurately check if a number is prime or not. Here's an optimized function for prime checking.
```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1 or (n % 2 == 0 and n > 2): 
        return False
    for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
In this function, we return `False` immediately if the number is less than or equal to 1 or if it is an even number larger than 2. For odd numbers larger than 2, we only check up to their square root. If we find any factors, we return `False`, otherwise `True`.

### Step 2: Test the Prime Checking Function
Test the function with some known prime and non-prime numbers to ensure its accuracy.
```python
assert is_prime(2) == True
assert is_prime(3) == True
assert is_prime(4) == False
assert is_prime(5) == True
assert is_prime(25) == False
assert is_prime(29) == True
```
### Step 3: Integrate the Function Into Your Code
Replace your current prime checking function with `is_prime` in your existing codebase. 

Remember to apply adequate checks on the parameter input to the function to prevent unexpected errors.
