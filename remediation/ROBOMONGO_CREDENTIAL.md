## Remediation Steps for MongoDB Credential Disclosure
MongoDB credential disclosure is a serious security concern. Without properly securing MongoDB, attackers may gain unauthorized access to sensitive data and use it maliciously. 

### Step 1: Enable Access Control
Enabling access control will require all clients to identify themselves before they can perform actions on the database.

You can enable access control using the `--auth` parameter when starting the `mongod` process.

```bash
mongod --auth
```

### Step 2: Create User Administrator
Once access control is enabled, you need to create the user administrator. The user administrator is a special user capable of adding, removing and managing other MongoDB users.

In the MongoDB shell, use the following commands:

```bash
use admin
db.createUser(
  {
    user: "myUserAdmin",
    pwd: "abc123",
    roles: [ { role: "userAdminAnyDatabase", db: "admin" } ]
  }
)
```

### Step 3: Authentication
To authenticate as the user administrator, you need to disconnect the MongoDB shell and reconnect with credentials.

```bash
mongo --port 27017 -u "myUserAdmin" -p "abc123" --authenticationDatabase "admin"
```

### Step 4: Create Additional Users
Once connected as the user administrator, you can create additional users as needed.

```bash
use myDatabase
db.createUser(
  {
    user: "myDBUser",
    pwd: "abc123",
    roles: [ { role: "readWrite", db: "myDatabase" } ]
  }
)
```
