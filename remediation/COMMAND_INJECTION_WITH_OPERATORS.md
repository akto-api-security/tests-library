# Remediation for COMMAND_INJECTION_WITH_OPERATORS

## Remediation Steps for Command Injection via Operators
Command injection is a serious security concern, where an attacker may inject commands that are executed by an application. This typically happens when user input is not properly sanitized or escaped, and it is passed into command line instructions.

### Step 1: Avoid the use of Eval
Never use `eval` or similar functions on data from untrusted sources, as it can execute arbitrary code.
```javascript
// This is bad
eval('ls ' + userInput); 

// Use this instead
var userInput = 'some input';
console.log(userInput);
```
### Step 2: Sanitize User Inputs
Sanitize user inputs before using them. This can be done by escaping special characters or by using functions that automatically handle these issues.
```javascript
var sanitizedInput = escape(userInput);
```
### Step 3: Use Parameterized Functions
When possible, use parameterized functions that can run operating system commands and do not allow for command chaining or inclusion of arbitrary commands. These functions typically accept command name and arguments separately, avoiding the use of shell and thus the risk of command injection.
```python
# Python
import subprocess
userInput = "user input"
subprocess.run(['ls', '-l', userInput])
```
### Step 4: Regular Auditing
Regularly audit your codebase to find and fix places where untrusted input may be directly used in function calls that interact with the operating system.
```bash
# Use auditing tools regularly
# example: using Bandit for Python
bandit -r path/to/your/python/code
```
### Step 5: Use Security Libraries
Use security libraries for user data sanitization like ESAPI library in Java
```java
// Java
import org.owasp.esapi.ESAPI;
String safe = ESAPI.encoder().encodeForOS( new WindowsCodec(), userInput );
```
