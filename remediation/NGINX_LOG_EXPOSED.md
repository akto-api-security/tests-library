# Remediation for NGINX_LOG_EXPOSED

## Remediation Steps for Nginx Log Exposure
Nginx log exposure is a serious security issue. If your logs are exposed, they can provide attackers with valuable information about your system and its vulnerabilities. 

Here is how you can mitigate this vulnerability:

### Step 1: Restrict Access to Log Files
Firstly, you need to restrict access to the log files. Only the necessary users should have the permissions to view these logs.

```bash
sudo chmod -R 640 /var/log/nginx/
sudo chown -R nginx:nginx /var/log/nginx/
```
### Step 2: Enable Access Logs
You might want to enable access logs in Nginx web server to monitor your websiteâ€™s traffic in detail. This information is extremely helpful in troubleshooting, performance evaluation and system resource planning.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
```

In the opened configuration file, add or uncomment the line:

```bash
access_log /var/log/nginx/access.log;
```

Save the changes and exit the text editor. To effect the changes, you'll need to restart Nginx:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

### Step 3: Configure Log Rotation
The logs should be rotated regularly to avoid filling up the disk space. This can be achieved using the logrotate utility.

Create a new configuration file for Nginx log rotation:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/logrotate.d/nginx
```

Add the following content to the file and save it:

```bash
/var/log/nginx/*log {
     daily
     missingok
     rotate 52
     compress
     delaycompress
     notifempty
     create 640 nginx adm
     sharedscripts
     postrotate
           /bin/kill -USR1 `cat /run/nginx.pid 2>/dev/null` 2>/dev/null || true
     endscript
}
```

Ensure logrotate is correctly set up by checking its status:

```bash
sudo logrotate --debug /etc/logrotate.d/nginx
```

### Step 4: Regular Audit and Update
Routinely check your logs to monitor for unusual activities and keep your Nginx server updated to the latest version to obtain new security patches.

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade nginx
```
