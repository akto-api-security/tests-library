# Remediation for SENSITIVE_DATA_EXPOSURE_INVOICE

## Remediation Steps for Sensitive Data Exposure for INVOICE
Sensitive data exposure for INVOICE is a serious security issue. When sensitive data such as invoice details are exposed, attackers could gain unauthorized access to critical data causing large financial losses and GDPR violations.

### Step 1: Encryption of Sensitive Data
Use encryption to protect sensitive data such as invoice details. This can be done using AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) or any other secure encryption methods.

For instance, if you are using Python you can use PyCryptodome library to encrypt and decrypt data:

```python
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
from Crypto.Util.Padding import pad, unpad
from Crypto.Random import get_random_bytes

def encrypt_data(data):
    key = get_random_bytes(16)
    cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC)
    ct_bytes = cipher.encrypt(pad(data, AES.block_size))
    return key, ct_bytes

def decrypt_data(key, ct_bytes):
    cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC)
    data = unpad(cipher.decrypt(ct_bytes), AES.block_size)
    return data
```

### Step 2: Role-based Access Control (RBAC)
Implement role-based access control to ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive data.

```java
if(user.getRole().equals("Admin") || user.getRole().equals("Finance")){
    return accessInvoiceData();
} else {
    return "Access Denied";
}
```

### Step 3: Implement Error Handling
Ensure that any error messages returned by the server do not divulge any sensitive information.

Example in Java:
```java
catch(SQLException e){
    logger.error("Database error. Please try again later.");
}
```
