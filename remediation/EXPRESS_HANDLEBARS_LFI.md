# Remediation for EXPRESS_HANDLEBARS_LFI

## Remediation Steps for Express-handlebars Local File Inclusion

Express-handlebars local file inclusion is a serious security issue where an attacker is able to include local files from the server-side on client requests. This poses a major threat as it can expose sensitive information like passwords, server configurations, etc.

### Step 1: Update Dependencies

Express-handlebars vulnerabilities are often fixed in newer releases. Ensure you're using the latest version to help address vulnerabilities that may have been fixed in more recent releases.

```bash
npm update express-handlebars
```

### Step 2: Sanitize User Input

Generally, one way to prevent Local File Inclusion (LFI) is by sanitizing data that's coming from users. In the code below, we use Node.js and express-validator middleware to sanitize user input.

```javascript
const { check, validationResult } = require('express-validator');

app.post('/user', [
  // username must be at least 5 chars long
  check('username').isLength({ min: 5 }),
  // trim and escape the data
  check('username').trim().escape(),
  //..more sanitizations for other input fields
], (req, res) => {
  // Find the validation errors in this request and wrap them in an object with handy functions
  const errors = validationResult(req);
  if (!errors.isEmpty()) {
    return res.status(400).json({ errors: errors.array() });
  }
  // continue with your logic
});
```

### Step 3: Limit Access to Files

Ensure the application runs with sufficient, but least required, privileges, to limit the files which can be exposed through local file inclusion.
