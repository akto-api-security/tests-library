## Remediation Steps for Gradle Library Version Disclosure

Library version disclosure can potentially allow attackers to exploit vulnerable versions of libraries in your application. To prevent this, you should avoid revealing library versions as much as possible.

### Step 1: Hide Library Versions in Manifest
In Gradle, library versions can often leak into the AndroidManifest.xml file. To avoid this, use a wildcard in the version field, like so:

```groovy
android {
    compileSdkVersion 29
    defaultConfig {
        minSdkVersion 21
        targetSdkVersion 29
        versionCode 1
        versionName "1.0"
    }
    ...
}
```

### Step 2: Remove Version Information from Package Names
Sometimes, the version of a library may appear in package names. To remove this:

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation("org.apache.httpcomponents:httpclient:*")
    implementation("org.apache.httpcomponents:httpcore:*")
    ...
}
```
