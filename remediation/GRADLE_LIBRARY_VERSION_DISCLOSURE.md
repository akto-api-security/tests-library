# Remediation for GRADLE_LIBRARY_VERSION_DISCLOSURE

## Remediation Steps for Gradle Library Version Disclosure

Library version disclosure can potentially allow attackers to exploit vulnerable versions of libraries in your application. To prevent this, you should avoid revealing library versions as much as possible.

### Step 1: Hide Library Versions in Manifest
In Gradle, library versions can often leak into the AndroidManifest.xml file. To avoid this, use a wildcard in the version field, like so:

```groovy
android {
    compileSdkVersion 29
    defaultConfig {
        minSdkVersion 21
        targetSdkVersion 29
        versionCode 1
        versionName "1.0"
    }
    ...
}
```

### Step 2: Remove Version Information from Package Names
Sometimes, the version of a library may appear in package names. To remove this:

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation("org.apache.httpcomponents:httpclient:*")
    implementation("org.apache.httpcomponents:httpcore:*")
    ...
}
```

### Step 3: Regular Updates and Audits
Make sure to regularly update and audit your libraries. This not only helps in fixing the vulnerability but can also reduce the risk of version disclosure if newer versions of a library have addressed this issue.

```bash
./gradlew dependencyUpdates
```
With these steps, your application can avoid exposing Gradle library versions publicly and thus, reducing the attack surface for potential attackers. Remember, security is an ongoing process and needs to stay updated with the latest trends and threats. 

This information shouldn't replace a full security audit, depending on the use case and nature of the application further security measures might be required.
