## Remediation Steps for SSRF Test for Redirect URI Parameter in Auth0 Authentication

Server Side Request Forgery(SSRF) in Redirect URI Parameter in Auth0 is a vulnerability that can allow an attacker to make HTTP requests from the application back end. By specifying a different URI, attackers can trick the server into making arbitrary requests which could potentially access sensitive data from the server or other services the server is able to communicate with. Here are the steps to remediate this vulnerability:

### Step 1: Properly Validate Redirect URI
You should try to hard-code the permissible redirect URIs in the Auth0 client dashboard. This way, you make sure only trustworthy URIs are allowed.

```python
ALLOWED_REDIRECT_URI = ['https://known-safe-01.com','https://known-safe-02.com']

def is_redirect_uri_allowed(uri: str) -> bool:
    return uri in ALLOWED_REDIRECT_URI
```

### Step 2: Apply URL Whitelisting
Whitelist the URIs to which the service can redirect. This can provide an additional layer of security, making sure only designated ones can be redirected to.

```python
ALLOWED_REDIRECT_URI_REGEX = re.compile(r"https:\/\/known-safe-[0-2]\.com")

def is_redirect_uri_allowed(uri: str) -> bool:
    return bool(ALLOWED_REDIRECT_URI_REGEX.match(uri))
```
