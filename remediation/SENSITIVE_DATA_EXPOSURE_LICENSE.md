# Remediation for SENSITIVE_DATA_EXPOSURE_LICENSE

## Remediation Steps for Sensitive Data Exposure - LICENSE
Sensitive data exposure, especially for software license information, is a serious security issue. If LICENSE files are not handled properly, attackers may gain unauthorized access to your licenses, potentially misusing them or causing legal repercussions with open-source software.
### Step 1: Move LICENSE to a Safer Location
The first thing you need to do is move your LICENSE file to a safer location. You can choose to move it to a hidden directory or to a safer server.
```bash
mv LICENSE /path/to/safer/location/
```
### Step 2: Update Paths in Your Code
Search your codebase for any reference to the LICENSE file and update its path.
```bash
grep -rl 'LICENSE' /path/to/your/code/ | xargs sed -i 's|LICENSE|/path/to/safer/location/LICENSE|g'
```
### Step 3: Restrict Access to LICENSE
You must restrict access to the LICENSE file. Only the system user running your application should have read permission over it. No other users should be able to read, write, or execute it.
```bash
chown your_user:your_user /path/to/safer/location/LICENSE
chmod 400 /path/to/safer/location/LICENSE
```
### Step 4: Regular Audit
Continuously review your source code for any new references to the LICENSE file. Also, conduct regular audits of your access control lists for the LICENSE file.
```bash
find /path/to/your/code/ -type f -print0 | xargs -0 grep -l "LICENSE"
```
### Step 5: Use .gitignore (If LICENSE is stored in a Git repository)
If your LICENSE file is stored in a Git repository, be sure to add it to your .gitignore file. This will prevent the LICENSE file from being tracked and pushed to the remote repository, thus preventing unauthorized access.
1. Open or create a .gitignore file in the root directory of your Git repository.
2. Type `LICENSE`, on a new line, and save the .gitignore file.
```bash
echo "LICENSE" >> .gitignore
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "Ignore LICENSE file to prevent sensitive data exposure"
```
