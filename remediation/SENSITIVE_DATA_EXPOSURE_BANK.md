# Remediation for SENSITIVE_DATA_EXPOSURE_BANK

## Remediation Steps for Sensitive Data Exposure

Sensitive data exposure is a potential security threat for financial institutions including banks. It involves adversaries gaining access to data that should be confidential such as credit card numbers, social security numbers, and bank account credentials. Here are some steps to help mitigate these risks:

### Step 1: Install and Enable Data encryption at rest and in transit
Data Encryption is very important to prevent sensitive data exposure. Use an encryption algorithm to encrypt all sensitive data.

Here's a sample for how you can encrypt using AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) in Python:

```python
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
import base64

def encryption(privateInfo):
    BLOCK_SIZE = 16
    PADDING = '{'
    
    pad = lambda s: s + (BLOCK_SIZE - len(s) % BLOCK_SIZE) * PADDING
    EncodeAES = lambda c, s: base64.b64encode(c.encrypt(pad(s)))
    secret = 'This is a key123'
    cipher = AES.new(secret)
   
    encoded = EncodeAES(cipher, privateInfo)
    return encoded
```

### Step 2: Implement Secure HTTPS Connections
It's important to ensure connections to and from your bank are secure. Here's how to set up a secure (HTTPS) server in Node.js:

```node
var https = require('https');
var fs = require('fs');

var options = {
  key: fs.readFileSync('test/fixtures/keys/agent2-key.pem'),
  cert: fs.readFileSync('test/fixtures/keys/agent2-cert.pem')
};

https.createServer(options, function (req, res) {
  res.writeHead(200);
  res.end("Secure connection!");
}).listen(8000);
```

### Step 3: Utilize Secure Password Hashing

Secure storage of passwords can prevent exposure of sensitive data. Use a strong cryptographic hash function like bcrypt. Here's an example:

```javascript
const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');
const saltRounds = 10;

bcrypt.hash('myPassword', saltRounds, function(err, hash) {
  // Store hash in your password DB. 
});
```
