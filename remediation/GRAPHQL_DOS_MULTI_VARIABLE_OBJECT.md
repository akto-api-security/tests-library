## Remediation Steps for Denial of Service Attack on GraphQL API

Denial of Service (DoS) attack on GraphQL API is a real threat if you have complex data structures. If those structures are resolved with deeply nested queries that include multiple variable objects in a single query, an attacker may exploit it to exhaust system resources, causing the service to be slow or even unavailable.

### Step 1: Implement a Maximum Query Depth

To protect your GraphQL API from such an attack, implement a maximum query depth. This defines how deeply nested a query can be. For example, in Apollo Server, you can use `graphql-depth-limit` integration.

Here's an example in JavaScript:

```javascript
const depthLimit = require('graphql-depth-limit')
const express = require('express')
const { ApolloServer } = require('apollo-server-express')

const typeDefs = // your GraphQL schema
const resolvers = // your GraphQL resolvers

const app = express()
const server = new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
  validationRules: [depthLimit(10)]
})

server.applyMiddleware({ app })
app.listen({ port: 4000 })
```
In the example above, we have set a maximum query depth of 10.

### Step 2: Limit the Complexity of GraphQL Queries

A single GraphQL query can potentially create a significant load on a server, particularly if it involves multiple relationships and variables. It's possible to determine the complexity of a query upfront and reject those that exceed a certain limit.

In Apollo Server, you can use `graphql-validation-complexity` to limit the complexity. Here's an example:

```javascript
const { createComplexityLimitRule } = require('graphql-validation-complexity')

const server = new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
  validationRules: [createComplexityLimitRule(1000)]
})
```

In the example above, we set a maximum complexity of 1000. Any query with a complexity higher than this will be rejected.

### Step 3: Pagination

Another best practice to limit the amount of data that clients can request from your server at once is to enforce pagination. This way, your server will only fetch and process a subset of your data at a time.

For example, in your resolvers:

```javascript
Query: {
  people: async (_, { first = 10, skip = 0 }) => {
    return await PeopleModel.find().skip(skip).limit(first)
  }
}
```

In this example, clients are required to provide 'first' to specify the number of items to fetch and 'skip' to specify how many items to ignore from the start.

### Step 4: Regular Monitor and Audit

Monitor your GraphQL API usage regularly and check for any suspicious activity. Update or patch up your security set up if `Maximum Query Depth` and `Limit on Query Complexity` are no longer effective, or if you detect a new way your GraphQL API is being exploited.
