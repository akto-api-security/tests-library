## Remediation Steps for BOLA Exploitation using Integer IDs in URL path

BOLA, also known as Broken Object Level Authorization, can be exploited to gain unauthorized access to data by manipulating the id values in the URL path. These vulnerabilities occur when an application allows direct referencing to a recordâ€™s primary key value, bypassing the regular authorization checks.

### Step 1: Validate and Authorize IDs
Firstly, ensure that the API validates and authorizes every ID that is used in a URL path, whether it's an integer ID or any other identifier. It's a standard practice to avoid leaking sensitive data.

In Python using Django framework, you can manage authorizations as follows:

```python
from django.shortcuts import get_object_or_404

def update_object(request, obj_id):
    # Assuming `ObjectModel` is an instance of Django Model
    # We use `get_object_or_404` method to ensure that 
    # the requested object belongs to the current user
    obj = get_object_or_404(ObjectModel, pk=obj_id, user=request.user)

    ...
```

### Step 2: Use UUID instead of Integer IDs
The use of a UUID or a similar complex identifier can also make it difficult for an attacker to manipulate the IDs found in URL paths. 

You can change the primary key in your Django Model to a UUID as follows:

```python
import uuid
from django.db import models

class ObjectModel(models.Model):
    id = models.UUIDField(primary_key=True, default=uuid.uuid4, editable=False)
    ...
```
