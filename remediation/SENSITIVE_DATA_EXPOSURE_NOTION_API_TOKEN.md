# Remediation for SENSITIVE_DATA_EXPOSURE_NOTION_API_TOKEN

## Remediation Steps for Sensitive Data Exposure of NOTION API TOKEN
Sensitive data exposure like the NOTION API TOKEN can lead to unauthorized access to the systems or database. Implementing measures to secure your tokens, keys and sensitive data can prevent exposing them.

### Step 1: Store Token in Environment Variables
Avoid hardcoding API tokens in your code. Instead, store them in environment variables on your server.

Here is a Python example using the `os` library:

```python
import os

NOTION_API_TOKEN = os.getenv('NOTION_API_TOKEN')
```

Then, set the environment variable in your server environment:

```bash
export NOTION_API_TOKEN="your_token"
```

### Step 2: Use .env Files for Local Development
For local development, use .env files to manage your environment variables and make sure to include .env in your .gitignore file to avoid pushing it to the version control system.

You can use `python-dotenv` package to load .env files in Python:

```bash
pip install python-dotenv
```

Then load .env file:

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()

NOTION_API_TOKEN = os.getenv('NOTION_API_TOKEN')
```
