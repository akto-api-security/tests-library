## Remediation Steps for Apache Airflow OS Command Injection

Apache Airflow allows programmatically authoring, scheduling, and monitoring workflows. An OS Command Injection vulnerability in Apache Airflow could potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on a server that is running Airflow.

### Step 1: Update Apache Airflow to Latest Version
First of all, update Apache Airflow to the most recent version. The development team at Apache often updates the software, addressing security vulnerabilities as they are discovered.

```bash
pip install --upgrade apache-airflow
```

### Step 2: Sanitize and Validate User Input
Sanitizing and validating user input is crucial to prevent OS command injection attacks. Avoid including user input in system commands whenever possible. If you need to, validate the input to ensure it doesn't contain any malicious code. Here's an example in Python:

```python
import shlex

def sanitize_input(input_data):
    return shlex.quote(input_data)

raw_input = "user input; rm -rf /"
sanitized_input = sanitize_input(raw_input)
```

### Step 3: Use Airflow Variables and Connections
Airflow has built-in support for Variables and Connections for storing sensitive data. Always utilize these over passing sensitive information through code. 

```python
from airflow.models import Variable

user_password = Variable.get('user_password')
```
