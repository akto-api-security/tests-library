# Remediation for PAYLOAD_KEYS_INVALID_VALUES

## Remediation Steps for Payload Keys Invalid Values

Invalid values in payload keys represent a security issue that could lead to unexpected behavior, application crashes, or even Malicious actions within your application. Here, we will assume you're working with JSON payloads in a Node.js API using Express and body-parser for simplicity.

### Step 1: Validate Payload Keys 

Every input received in the payload of the API request should be validated. One could use a library such as 'joi' for this. 

```javascript
const Joi = require('joi');
  
// define the validation schema
const schema = Joi.object().keys({
    name: Joi.string().required(),
    email: Joi.string().email().required(),
    password: Joi.string().required(),
});
```
In the above code, the name, email, and password are required fields in the payload.

### Step 2: Apply Validation to Routes

The validation needs to be applied to the specific routes. For instance, if the schema is for a user registration route:

```javascript
app.post('/register', (req, res) => {
    const result = Joi.validate(req.body, schema);
 
    if (result.error) {
        res.status(400).send(result.error.details[0].message);
        return;
    }
 
    res.send('Payload is valid');
});
```
In the above snippet, the `/register route` is checked for payload validity before processing.

### Step 3: Error Handling

In case of an invalid payload, the user should be informed with a properly formed error message.

```javascript
if (result.error) {
    res.status(400).send(result.error.details[0].message);
    return;
}
```

Above, if the validation fails, a 400 status error is sent to the user with the relevant error message.
