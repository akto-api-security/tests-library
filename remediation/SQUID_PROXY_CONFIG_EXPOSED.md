# Remediation for SQUID_PROXY_CONFIG_EXPOSED

## Remediation Steps for Squid Proxy Config Exposure
Exposure of Squid Proxy configuration files may pose a significant security threat. Attackers with access to these files can view sensitive information, causing a potential breach to your system's security. The following steps can help remediate this issue.

### Step 1: Restrict Access to Squid Proxy Configuration Files

Modify the file permissions to ensure only authorized users can access the Squid Proxy configuration files.

```bash
sudo chmod 600 /etc/squid/squid.conf
sudo chown squid:squid /etc/squid/squid.conf
```
### Step 2: Restrict Network Access 

Ensure only trusted network addresses can connect to your proxy server.

Open the Squid Proxy configuration file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/squid/squid.conf
```

Add the following lines, replacing 'trusted_ip' with the IP address(es) you trust:

```bash
acl trusted_net src trusted_ip/32
http_access allow trusted_net
```
After that, ensure you deny all other addresses:

```bash
http_access deny all
```
To save and close the file, press `Ctrl + X`, then `Y`, then `Enter`.

### Step 3: Restart Squid Service

Restart the Squid service to apply the changes:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart squid.service
```

### Step 4: Regular Audit and Update

To prevent exposure, periodically check the permissions of the Squid Proxy configuration files and update Squid Proxy software regularly:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade squid
```
This will ensure your Squid Proxy is kept up-to-date, mitigating potential vulnerabilities from outdated versions.
