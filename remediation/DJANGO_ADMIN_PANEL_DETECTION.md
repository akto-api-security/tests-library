# Remediation for DJANGO_ADMIN_PANEL_DETECTION

## Remediation Steps for Django Admin Panel Detection

Detecting the Django admin panel implies that it is exposed to the internet, which is a severe security threat. If the admin panel is exposed, attackers could potentially gain unauthorized access to the application data by brute forcing or using the leaked credentials. Following are the steps to remediate the issue:

### Step 1: Change Admin URL

The default Django admin URL is r'^admin/', which is commonly known and therefore prone to attack. Changing it to something less predictable can help withstand automated attacks.

```python
# urls.py
from django.conf.urls import include, url

urlpatterns = [
    url(r'^my-custom-admin/', include(admin.site.urls)),
]
```
Remember to change 'my-custom-admin' to something more ambiguous that only the administrators are aware of.

### Step 2: Restrict Access to Admin

Restrict the access by IP addresses. This could be configured in Django middleware. Please note that if your users connect over IPv6, it's important to add their IPv6 addresses for access control also.

```python
# middleware.py
from django.http import HttpResponseForbidden

class AdminIPRestrictionMiddleware(object):
    def __init__(self, get_response):
        self.get_response = get_response

    def __call__(self, request):
        # Add your trusted IPs here
        allowed_ips = ['<ip_address1>', '<ip_address2>', 'etc.']
        ip = request.META.get('REMOTE_ADDR')

        if request.path.startswith('/admin/') and ip not in allowed_ips:
            return HttpResponseForbidden('<h1>Forbidden</h1>')
        
        response = self.get_response(request)
        return response
```
Remember to replace '<ip_address1>', '<ip_address2>', 'etc.' with the real IP addresses of your trusted systems.

### Step 3: Use Strong Passwords

Enforce the use of strong passwords for all admin accounts. The Django documentation suggests using the built-in `django.contrib.auth.password_validation` module.

```python
# settings.py
AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS = [
    {
        'NAME': 'django.contrib.auth.password_validation.UserAttributeSimilarityValidator',
    },
    {
        'NAME': 'django.contrib.auth.password_validation.MinimumLengthValidator',
        'OPTIONS': {
            'min_length': 12,
        }
    },
]
```
This ensures that passwords must be at least 12 characters long and cannot be too similar to the user's other personal information.

### Step 4: Enable HTTPS

Secure the admin panel by enabling HTTPS. Djangoâ€™s built-in server does not support HTTPS, so deploying it securely would likely involve configuring a separate reverse proxy server to serve the Django application over HTTPS.

### Step 5: Regular Audit and Update

Regularly audit your Django project and update the Django admin panel accordingly to mitigate any new vulnerabilities.
