# Remediation for XXE_ERROR_BASED_TEST

## Remediation Steps for XML Error Based Vulnerability Test in API Endpoints

This vulnerability is based on XML error which can expose sensitive information about the internal workings of the software to an attacker. It is a serious security concern. Here are their respective remediation steps.

### Step 1: Disallow Detailed Error Messages

The prime cause of this vulnerability is providing too much information to the user. 

```java
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.ControllerAdvice;
import org.springframework.web.servlet.mvc.method.annotation.ResponseEntityExceptionHandler;

@ControllerAdvice
public class CustomizedResponseEntityExceptionHandler extends ResponseEntityExceptionHandler {
    // All Exception handlers can be kept here
}
```

### Step 2: Validate Incoming XML 

With the use of DTD, an XML document is well formed and validated properly.

```java
import javax.xml.XMLConstants;
import javax.xml.validation.Schema;
import javax.xml.validation.SchemaFactory;
import javax.xml.validation.Validator;

public class XMLValidator {
    public boolean validateXMLSchema(String xsdPath, String xmlPath){
        try {
            SchemaFactory factory = 
                    SchemaFactory.newInstance(XMLConstants.W3C_XML_SCHEMA_NS_URI);
            Schema schema = factory.newSchema(new File(xsdPath));
            Validator validator = schema.newValidator();
            validator.validate(new StreamSource(new File(xmlPath)));
        } catch (IOException | SAXException e) {
            return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Adopt an API Security Gateways

The adoption of API security gateways can monitor and block malicious activity emanating from XML requests.

```java
// Code varies vastly depending upon Security Gateway used.
```

### Step 4: Regular Security Update and Patching

Continuous security updates protect the API endpoints from any new vulnerabilities.

```bash
# This can vary and would generally be specific to the software and OS you are using.
```

If any step doesnâ€™t work as expected, troubleshoot it based on error messages or refer to the documentation for the specific technologies you are using.
