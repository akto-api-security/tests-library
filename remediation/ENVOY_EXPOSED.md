## Remediation Steps for Envoy Configuration Exposure
Envoy Configuration Exposure can lead to potential security issues. It can allow attackers to acquire unauthorized and valuable information about your systems which may lead to further exploitations.

### Step 1: Limit Access to Envoy Configuration
Limit access to the Envoy configuration by using proper access control list (ACLs). This can be done by setting file permissions to restrict who can read the configuration files.
```bash
chmod 700 /path/to/envoy-config
```

### Step 2: Secure Network Traffic
To protect the information while it is transmitted over network, it's recommended to secure the transport by enabling TLS encryption.
```bash
envoy --config-path /etc/envoy/envoy.yaml --mode serve --local-address-ip-version v4 --disable-hot-restart
```

In the above command, '/etc/envoy/envoy.yaml' is path to envoy configuration and change it accordingly. Following is an example to enable HTTPS.

```yaml
static_resources:
  listeners:
  - name: listener_0
    address:
    socket_address: { address: 0.0.0.0, port_value: 10000 }
    filter_chains:
    - filters:
      - name: envoy.filters.network.http_connection_manager
        typed_config:
          "@type": type.googleapis.com/envoy.extensions.filters.network.http_connection_manager.v3.HttpConnectionManager
          codec_type: AUTO
          stat_prefix: ingress_http
          use_remote_address: true
          route_config:
            name: local_route
            virtual_hosts:
            - name: local_service
              domains: ["*"]
              routes:
              - match: { prefix: "/" }
                route: { cluster: service_https }
          http_filters:
          - name: envoy.filters.http.router
```
