# Remediation for MANIPULATING_POINTS_MULTIPLIER

## Remediation Steps for Manipulating Reward/Cashback/User Points Multiplier

Manipulating reward/cashback/user points multipliers can impose severe security risks as attackers might gain unauthorized access to the multiplier's logic and manipulate it to their advantage. 

### Step 1: Validate Points on Server-side

Never trust the client-side data; always validate on the server-side. The multiplier rates must be defined and manipulated on server-side only.
The server should calculate the final points instead of receiving them from the client.

```java
public double calculateRewardPoints(int basePoints, double multiplier) {
    return basePoints * multiplier;
}
```

### Step 2: Enforce Access Control

Only authorized personnel should have access to update the multiplier.

```python
def update_multiplier(user, new_multiplier):
    if user.is_authorized:    
        system_config.reward_multiplier = new_multiplier
    else: 
        raise PermissionError("User does not have the necessary permissions.")
```

### Step 3: Logging and Auditing

Track multiplier changes in application logs. Regular audits can help detect suspicious activity.

```javascript
let rewardMultiplier = 2.0;
console.log(`[Application LOG] Initial Reward Multiplier Set: ${rewardMultiplier}`);
...

function setRewardMultiplier(newMultiplier, user) {
    if(user.is_authorized) {
        console.log(`[Audit LOG] Reward Multiplier changed from ${rewardMultiplier} to ${newMultiplier} by User - ${user.id}`);
        rewardMultiplier = newMultiplier;
    } else {
        console.log(`[SECURITY LOG] Unauthorized attempt to change Reward Multiplier by User - ${user.id}`);
        throw new Error('Unauthorized action');
    }
}
```

### Step 4: Encrypt Sensitive Data

If the multiplier needs to be stored, ensure it's encrypted, and securely handled.

```python
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet
cipher_suite = Fernet(key) # key should be stored securely
ciphered_text = cipher_suite.encrypt(b"2.0") # Assume 2.0 is the multiplier
multiplier = ciphered_text
```

### Step 5: Regularly Update Security Patches

Regularly update your software to include the latest security patches.
