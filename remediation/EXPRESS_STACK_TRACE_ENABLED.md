# Remediation for EXPRESS_STACK_TRACE_ENABLED

## Remediation Steps for Express Stack Trace Enabled
Leaving Express stack trace enabled is a serious security vulnerability as it can expose important application details to potential attackers. This information can be utilized to exploit discovered vulnerabilities more effectively. Follow the steps below to disable Express stack trace.

### Step 1: Environment Setup
Set up your environment. Express should not show stack trace in production environment by default, so ensure your environment is production.
```bash
export NODE_ENV=production
```
### Step 2: Error Handling Middleware
Configure express middleware function to handle errors. In Express, error handling middleware always take four arguments. We do not expose error message when the application is in production environment.

```javascript
app.use(function(err, req, res, next) {
  if (app.get('env') === 'development') {
    res.status(err.status || 500);
    res.render('error', {
      message: err.message,
      error: err
    });
  } else {
    res.status(err.status || 500);
    res.render('error', {
      message: 'Something went wrong!',
      error: {}
    });
  }
});
```
### Step 3: Ensure secure coding practices
When developing applications with Express, ensure not to include sensitive data or callbacks in your responses. 

### Step 4: Update Express regularly
Always ensure your Express.js software is up to date, as new versions often include security patches.

For example, to update Express you can run:
```bash
npm update express
```

In addition, be sure to diligently monitor and respond to security announcements related to Express.js and your server software. This will ensure any future vulnerabilities are resolved promptly.
