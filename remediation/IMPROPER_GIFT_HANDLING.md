## Remediation Steps for Improper Gift Code Handling for Transactions

Improper handling of gift codes during transactions can lead to serious security breaches. Attackers may use this flaw to gain unauthorized access to funds or make fraudulent transactions. 

To mitigate these issues, it's essential to follow a secure coding practice that ensures the privacy and integrity of gift codes.

### Step 1: Validate Gift Code 

Every gift code must be validated before it can be used in a transaction. This process of validating the gift code can be done on server side. If it's a genuine code, then proceed with the transaction; else, cancel the transaction. 

```python
def validate_gift_code(gift_code):
    # Check if gift code exists in the database
    if not gift_code_exists_in_db(gift_code):
        return False
    # If gift code exists, then check its status
    else:
        if check_gift_code_status(gift_code) == "Valid":
            return True
        else:
            return False

def make_transaction(gift_code):
    if validate_gift_code(gift_code) == True:
        # Proceed with transaction
        pass
    else:
        # Cancel transaction or request another gift code
        pass
```

### Step 2: Encrypt Gift Codes 

In order to secure the gift codes from being tampered with or stolen, always store them in encrypted form in the database. 

```python
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet

def encrypt_gift_code(gift_code):
    # Store this key well - it's required for decoding
    key = Fernet.generate_key()
    cipher_suite = Fernet(key)
    encrypted_code = cipher_suite.encrypt(gift_code)
    return encrypted_code
```

### Step 3: Limited Attempt 

In order to detour brute forcing the gift codes, there should be a limit to the number of attempts a user can input a gift code in a fixed amount of time and upon reaching this limit the user must be blocked from inputting gift code for a set duration.

```python
MAX_ATTEMPTS = 5
BLOCK_DURATION = 10 # in minutes

def check_attempt(userId):
    attempts = get_attempt_count_from_db(userId)

    if attempts >= MAX_ATTEMPTS:
        # Block user from making more attempts for BLOCK_DURATION
        block_user(userId, BLOCK_DURATION)
        return False

    # If attempts < MAX_ATTEMPTS, allow transaction
    return True
```
