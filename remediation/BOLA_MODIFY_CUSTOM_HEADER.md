# Remediation for BOLA_MODIFY_CUSTOM_HEADER

## Remediation Steps for BOLA (Broken Object Level Authorization) Exploitation

Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA) exploitation is a serious security vulnerability. It involves attackers manipulating object references to gain unauthorized access. BOLA can be exploited via custom headers or parameters. Here are some of the steps for remediation:

### Step 1: Validate User Authorization
Ensure that the application verifies the user's authorization before processing the request.

```python
def authorize_request(user, object_reference):
  if not user.is_authorized_for(object_reference):
    raise UnauthorizedError(f"User {user.id} is not authorized to access {object_reference}")
```

### Step 2: Replace Direct Object References with Indirect References
If possible, use indirect object references (IDORs) which are not manipulable.

```java
public String getIndirectReference(String directReference) {
  return this.indirectReferenceMap.get(directReference);
}
```

### Step 3: Implement Rate Limiting and Monitoring
To mitigate against fuzzing attacks, implement rate-limiting and monitor for suspicious activity.

```ruby
# In a Rails application
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  before_action :detect_suspicious_activity

  private

  def detect_suspicious_activity
    if request_too_frequent?
      render status: :too_many_requests
    end
  end

  def request_too_frequent?
    # Implement your rate limiting logic here
  end
end
```
