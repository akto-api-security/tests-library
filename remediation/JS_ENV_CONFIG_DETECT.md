# Remediation for JS_ENV_CONFIG_DETECT

## Remediation Steps for JavaScript Environment Configuration Detection Test
JavaScript Environment Configuration Test vulnerability arises due to the exposure of sensitive configuration information about the runtime environment. This could potentially be utilized by an attacker to exploit known vulnerabilities specific to the environment. 

### Step 1: Hide JavaScript Environment Information
In JavaScript, remove any unnecessary `console.log()` or other debugging information that might expose sensitive configuration details. For instance, avoid using this:
```javascript
console.log(process.env);
```
### Step 2: Use a Secure Alternative for Environment Variables
Instead of exposing your environment variables directly, use a secure alternative like `dotenv` to load your variables as a configuration. An example of how you can do this:
```javascript
require('dotenv').config();
```
Ensure to add your `.env` file in your `.gitignore` so that your environment variables do not get pushed to public repositories.
