## Remediation Steps for Exploiting BOLA by Replacing URL Path with API Version IDs for Unauthorized Access for PUT/PATCH Based APIs

Exploiting Broken Object-Level Authorization (BOLA) by replacing the URL path with API Version IDs can be a damaging security flaw. This can allow unauthorized users access to modify data through PUT/PATCH methods. Here is a list of steps to remediate this security issue:

### Step 1: Validate User Access
Ensure that you validate user access before proceeding to execute the method. Each user's access level should be checked against the requested action.

```javascript
app.put('/api/:versionId', (req, res) => {
  if (!req.user || !userHasAccess(req.user, req.params.versionId)) {
    res.status(403).send('Forbidden');
    return;
  }  
  // further code execution
});
```
### Step 2: Map API Versions to URLs Directly
As a preventive measure, instead of accepting API versionID raw from user-provided input (URL path), map API versions to URLs directly in your code to avoid unexpected API access.

```javascript
const apiVersions = {
  '1.0': '/api-1.0-endpoint',
  '2.0': '/api-2.0-endpoint', 
  // add more versions as your application grows 
};

app.put(apiVersions[req.params.versionId], function(req, res) {
  // Handle the request here
});
```
### Step 3: Limit HTTP Verb Permissions
Limiting the HTTP verbs that can be used with APIs can reduce unwanted actions from being carried out. Specifically, restrict actions like PUT or PATCH to only those user roles that absolutely require it. 

```javascript
app.put(apiVersions[req.params.versionId], function(req, res) {
  if (req.user && req.user.role === 'admin') {
    // Handle the request here
  } else {
    res.status(403).send('Forbidden');
  }
});
```
