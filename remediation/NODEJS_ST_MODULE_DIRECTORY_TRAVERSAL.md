# Remediation for NODEJS_ST_MODULE_DIRECTORY_TRAVERSAL

## Remediation Steps for Node.js `st` Module Directory Traversal

The `st` module in Node.js is subject to a directory traversal vulnerability. If not properly secured, an attacker can access files outside of the designated folder in a server setting, leading to potential unauthorized access to sensitive files or system information.

This issue can be mitigated by updating the `st` module to version 2.0.0 or higher, which contains a fix for this vulnerability. Following step-by-step guide will help you apply the required remediation.

### Step 1: Update `st` Module

First, ensure that you have the latest version of the `st` module. You can update the `st` module to the latest version by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install st@latest
```

### Step 2: Validate Update

You can validate that you're using a secure version of the `st` module by checking your `package.json` file or providing the following command:

```bash
npm list st
```

The version reported should be 2.0.0 or higher.

### Step 3: Comprehensive Testing

After updating the package, ensure to comprehensively test your application to make sure that the upgrade didn't introduce any unexpected issues or breaking changes.

### Step 4: Regular Audit and Update 

Run regular audits for known vulnerabilities in your installed packages with the `npm audit` command:

```bash
npm audit
```

The `npm audit` command will check your application against the npm Advisory database, and it will provide information on how to remediate any issues that it finds. Regularly conducting audits and maintaining updated versions of all packages will help keep your application secure. 

Keep in mind that the best way to protect yourself from such attacks is to be vigilant about the modules and versions you are using and to update regularly.
