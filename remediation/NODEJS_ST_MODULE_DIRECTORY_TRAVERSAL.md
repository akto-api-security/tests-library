## Remediation Steps for Node.js `st` Module Directory Traversal

The `st` module in Node.js is subject to a directory traversal vulnerability. If not properly secured, an attacker can access files outside of the designated folder in a server setting, leading to potential unauthorized access to sensitive files or system information.

This issue can be mitigated by updating the `st` module to version 2.0.0 or higher, which contains a fix for this vulnerability. Following step-by-step guide will help you apply the required remediation.

### Step 1: Update `st` Module

First, ensure that you have the latest version of the `st` module. You can update the `st` module to the latest version by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install st@latest
```

### Step 2: Validate Update

You can validate that you're using a secure version of the `st` module by checking your `package.json` file or providing the following command:

```bash
npm list st
```

The version reported should be 2.0.0 or higher.
