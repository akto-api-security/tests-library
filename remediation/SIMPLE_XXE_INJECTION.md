## Remediation Steps for Basic XML External Entity (XXE) Vulnerability Test in API Endpoints

XXE vulnerability is a common and serious security flaw within applications that parse XML input. This vulnerability can be used by an attacker to interfere with the application's processing of XML data, leading to disclosure of internal files, Denial of Service, Server Side Request Forgery, or other internal network probing. 

### Step 1: Disable XML External Entity Processing

Most modern XML parsers disable entity processing by default. However, it is considered a good practice to explicitly disable it in your XML processing code. Below is an example using Java's DocumentBuilderFactory:

```java
DocumentBuilderFactory dbf = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();
dbf.setFeature("http://apache.org/xml/features/disallow-doctype-decl", true);
```

### Step 2: Update Outdated XML Parsers

Ensure to always use the latest versions of XML parsers as they often come with security enhancements and patches for known vulnerabilities like XXE.

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
```

### Step 3: Use Less Complex Data Formats

If possible, use less complex data formats such as JSON, and avoid serialization of sensitive data.

### Step 4: Implement Access Controls

Protect your files by implementing access controls. Set file permissions carefully to avoid unauthorized access.

```bash
chmod 700 /path/to/directory
chmod 600 /path/to/file
```

### Step 5: Use External Libraries

Use external libraries that specifically address XXE, they often follow the best and the most updated security practices. For instance, when parsing an XML document using 'lxml' library in Python, you can disable DTD (Document Type Definition) validation and external entity processing like so:

```python
from lxml import etree

parser = etree.XMLParser(resolve_entities=False)
etree.fromstring(your_xml_string, parser)
```
