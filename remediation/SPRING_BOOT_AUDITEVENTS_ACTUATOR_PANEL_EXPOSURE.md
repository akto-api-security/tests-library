# Remediation for SPRING_BOOT_AUDITEVENTS_ACTUATOR_PANEL_EXPOSURE

## Remediation Steps for Spring Boot AuditEvents Actuator Panel Exposure
Exposure of the Spring Boot Actuator's AuditEvents panel can provide an attacker with sensitive information about the state of your application, potentially increasing the security risk.

### Step 1: Disable Actuator Panel Exposure

The first and most direct solution is to disable the exposure of sensitive actuators. 

In your Spring Boot's `application.properties` or `application.yml` file, include the following:

```yaml
management.endpoints.web.exposure.exclude=*
```

or

```properties
management.endpoints.web.exposure.exclude=*
```

### Step 2: Enable Actuator Security

You can secure sensitive endpoint, such as `auditevents`, by adding security to your application. Add the following dependency to your Maven `pom.xml` or Gradle `build.gradle` file to include Spring Security:

Maven:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-security</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

Gradle:

```groovy
implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-security'
```

And configure security for the endpoints in your security configuration:

```java
@Configuration
public class ActuatorSecurity extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http.requestMatcher(EndpointRequest.toAnyEndpoint()).authorizeRequests()
                .anyRequest().authenticated()
                .and().httpBasic();
    }
}
```

Remember to set up your user name and password for Spring Security in your `application.properties` or `application.yml` file:

```yaml
spring.security.user.name: admin
spring.security.user.password: secret
```

or 

```properties
spring.security.user.name=admin
spring.security.user.password=secret
```

### Step 3: Restrict Actuator exposure to a specific IP range

You can also restrict the access to your actuator endpoints by IP range. In `application.properties` or `application.yml`, you can configure Spring Boot Actuator settings to restrict access:

```properties
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=health,info
management.endpoints.web.base-path=/
management.endpoints.web.path-mapping.health=health
management.endpoints.web.path-mapping.info=info
```
These settings included only Health and Info endpoints and mapped them to the root path.
