# Remediation for COMMAND_INJECTION_COOKIE_HEADER_CHAINED

## Remediation Steps for Command Injection In Cookie Header
Command injections in a cookie header is a severe security issue where an attacker can send commands that can potentially get executed on the server as a part of the http request process. This can be devastating as it opens up a path for unauthorized actions.

### Step 1: Input Validation
Ensure all input is validated before further processing. This can be done by setting cookie values with regex that excludes special characters. For example, in Node.js, this might look like the following:

```javascript
var express = require('express');
var cookieParser = require('cookie-parser');
var RegExp = require("regex");
var app = express();
app.use(cookieParser());

app.get('/', function(req, res){
  // Check for special characters
  var specialChars = new RegExp('^[a-zA-Z0-9_]*$');
  
  if(!specialChars.test(req.cookies.cookieName)){
    res.send('Invalid characters in cookie value.');
  } else {
    // Processing the cookie value
  }
});
```

### Step 2: Output Encoding
Ensure that all output is encoded, to prevent the execution of any commands unintentionally.

```javascript
var escape = require('escape-html');
//...
res.send(escape(req.cookies.cookieName);
```

### Step 3: Parameterized Queries
Ensure all database queries use parameterized queries or prepared statements. This ensures that if an attacker does attempt to execute a command through the cookie, it will not function as intended.


```javascript
const mysql = require('mysql');
const conn = mysql.createConnection(databaseConfig);

conn.query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?', [req.cookies.userId], function(error, results, fields){
  // Process results here
});
```
