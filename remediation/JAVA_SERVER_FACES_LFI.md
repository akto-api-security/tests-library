# Remediation for JAVA_SERVER_FACES_LFI

## Remediation Steps for Java Server Faces Local File Inclusion

Java Server Faces (JSF) Local File Inclusion (LFI) is a serious security issue which allows an attacker to read files from the server without any check. Here are the remediation steps to fix this vulnerability:

### Step 1: Input Validation

Ensure that all inputs are properly validated. Untrusted input should never be used directly in file operations.

```java
// Example code
if (isValidInput(userInput)) {
    File file = new File(userInput);
    // Operations on the file
}
```

### Step 2: Update JSF libraries

Update your JSF library to the latest version as there were some vulnerabilities that were fixed in the JSF 2.2.12.

```bash
# Maven example
mvn versions:use-latest-versions -Dincludes=javax.faces:javax.faces-api
```

### Step 3: Implement a whitelist mechanism

Implement a whitelist of allowable files and file paths, disallowing external accessible directories.

```java
// Example code
List<String> whitelistedPaths = Arrays.asList("/allowedDir1", "/allowedDir2");
if (whitelistedPaths.contains(userInput)) {
    // Perform file operation
}
```

### Step 4: Regular Security Audits and Testing

Make use of up-to-date automatic vulnerability scanning tools to regularly scan your applications for security vulnerabilities. Regular penetration testing by a skilled tester can also help unearthing vulnerabilities.

```bash
# Example with OWASP ZAP tool
./zap.sh -quickurl http://target-app-url
```

Stay updated with new security best practices and refactor your code accordingly. Avoid the use of deprecated or insecure APIs or libraries.
