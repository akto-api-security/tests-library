# Remediation for LDAP_ERRORS

## Remediation Steps for LDAP Injection

LDAP Injection is a serious security issue which could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data on your LDAP directory. It involves exploiting applications by injecting LDAP statements into input fields.

### Step 1: Input Validation:

User input should not directly be incorporated into LDAP statements without first being properly sanitized. Here is an example in Python language:

```python
import re

# Function that validates user input
def validate_input(user_input):
  pattern = re.compile('[\W_]+')
  sanitized_input = pattern.sub('', user_input)
  return sanitized_input

# Usage of the function
user_input = input("Please provide your user ID: ")
user_id = validate_input(user_input)
```
This Python code uses a regex pattern to remove unwanted characters from the user input which would sanitize it and make it safe.

### Step 2: Use Parameterized Queries:

Instead of creating LDAP queries via string concatenation, use parameterized queries or prepared statements. Here is an example in Java:

```java
import javax.naming.directory.*;

// Set up environment for creating initial context
Hashtable<String, Object> env = new Hashtable<String, Object>(11);
env.put(Context.INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY,"com.sun.jndi.ldap.LdapCtxFactory");

// Use a parameterized query to prevent injection
String filter = "(uid={0})";
String[] attrIDs = {"cn"};
SearchControls ctls = new SearchControls();
ctls.setReturningAttributes(attrIDs);
ctls.setSearchScope(SearchControls.SUBTREE_SCOPE);

// Pass in parameter
namingContext.search("ou=people,ou=contacts", filter, new String[] {uid}, ctls);
```
Using a parameterized query like this one helps to ensure that any incoming data is treated purely as a string and not part of the query.

### Step 3: Employ Least Privilege Principle:

The application should use an account that has the fewest privileges to perform its job. This way, even if an attacker is able to use LDAP Injection to execute arbitrary commands, they will not be able to change any critical data.
