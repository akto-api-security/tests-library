# Remediation for KUBEVIEW_INFO_DISCLOSURE

## Remediation Steps for KubeView Information Disclosure

KubeView Information Disclosure is a potential vulnerability where sensitive information can be leaked due to misconfigured or unauthorized access to the Kubernetes cluster. 

To remedy this security issue, you need to implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to limit the information that can be viewed or accessed. Appropriate rules and roles should be created and assigned to different users, services, or applications as per the principle of least privilege.

Here is a simple example of how to create a Role and RoleBinding in Kubernetes using a yaml file:

### Step 1: Create a new Role

Create a new Role with limited permissions using the following YAML:

```yaml
kind: Role
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  namespace: default
  name: pod-reader
rules:
- apiGroups: [""] # "" indicates the core API group
  resources: ["pods"]
  verbs: ["get", "watch", "list"]
```
To apply this role, use `kubectl`:

```bash
kubectl apply -f role.yaml
```

### Step 2: Bind Role to a User/Service

You can use a RoleBinding to bind the above Role to a specific user. For instance:

```yaml
kind: RoleBinding
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: read-pods
  namespace: default
subjects:
- kind: User
  name: john
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef:
  kind: Role
  name: pod-reader
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

To apply this role binding, use `kubectl`:

```bash
kubectl apply -f rolebinding.yaml
```

### Step 3: Regular Audit and Update

You should regularly review the RBAC policies and their bindings and update them as necessary. This can help in ensuring that the access control policies are up-to-date and secure. Regularly check cluster roles and role bindings using the following commands:

```bash
kubectl get clusterrolebindings
kubectl get roles --all-namespaces
kubectl get rolebindings --all-namespaces
```

Remember, the overall security of your Kubernetes deployment also depends on how well it's configured and maintained. Always follow best practices for Kubernetes security.
