# Remediation for KUBEVIEW_INFO_DISCLOSURE

## Remediation Steps for KubeView Information Disclosure

KubeView Information Disclosure is a potential vulnerability where sensitive information can be leaked due to misconfigured or unauthorized access to the Kubernetes cluster. 

To remedy this security issue, you need to implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to limit the information that can be viewed or accessed. Appropriate rules and roles should be created and assigned to different users, services, or applications as per the principle of least privilege.

Here is a simple example of how to create a Role and RoleBinding in Kubernetes using a yaml file:

### Step 1: Create a new Role

Create a new Role with limited permissions using the following YAML:

```yaml
kind: Role
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  namespace: default
  name: pod-reader
rules:
- apiGroups: [""] # "" indicates the core API group
  resources: ["pods"]
  verbs: ["get", "watch", "list"]
```
To apply this role, use `kubectl`:

```bash
kubectl apply -f role.yaml
```

### Step 2: Bind Role to a User/Service

You can use a RoleBinding to bind the above Role to a specific user. For instance:

```yaml
kind: RoleBinding
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: read-pods
  namespace: default
subjects:
- kind: User
  name: john
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef:
  kind: Role
  name: pod-reader
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

To apply this role binding, use `kubectl`:

```bash
kubectl apply -f rolebinding.yaml
```
