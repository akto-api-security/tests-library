# Remediation for LFI_IN_PATH

## Remediation Steps for Local File Inclusion (LFI) in Path
Local File Inclusion (LFI) is a serious security issue that allows an attacker to read and potentially execute files on the server. LFI can occur when user input that is used in file operations is not properly validated. 

### Step 1: Input Validation
Before accepting user input that will be included in file operation functions, validate the input information. Here's a code example in PHP:

```php
$file = basename($_GET['file']); 
if (file_exists("/path/to/app/files/{$file}")) {
    include "/path/to/app/files/{$file}";
}
```

### Step 2: Use Allowlist
Create an allowlist of files that are allowed to be included. This can be done via an array or a database of some kind.

```php
$allowed_files = ['file1.php', 'file2.php', 'file3.php'];
$file = basename($_GET['file']);

if (in_array($file, $allowed_files) && file_exists("/path/to/app/files/{$file}")) {
    include "/path/to/app/files/{$file}";
}
```

### Step 3: Disable Error Reporting
Misconfigured error reporting can give valuable information to attackers. It's best to disable error reporting, or to give very generic error messages that don't reveal too much about your setup.

In PHP, you can disable error reporting like this:

```php
error_reporting(0);
```

### Step 4: Disable PHP Wrappers
PHP code often uses wrappers that present potential paths for LFI attacks. To prevent their use, disable or limit them by using `open_basedir` on your PHP configuration file.

```ini
open_basedir = "/var/www/html:/usr/lib/php:/tmp"
```
