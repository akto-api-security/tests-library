# Remediation for SERVER_PRIVATE_KEYS

## Remediation Steps for Detecting Private SSH, TLS, and JWT Keys Exposure

Exposure of Private SSH, TLS and JWT keys is a critical security issue. These keys are highly sensitive data used for encryption and identity verification. Unauthorized access to these keys could lead to serious data breaches. Here are the remediation steps:

### Step 1: Secure Handling and Storage of Keys

Use encryption for sensitive data at rest. Don't embed keys in your source code. Instead, use environment variables or secure server system properties. 

Ideally, use a secure, centrally managed key storage solution such as AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault, Google Cloud KMS, or Hashicorp Vault.

```python
import os

# Instead of hardcoding private keys
# private_key = "my_super_secret_key"

# Use environment variables
private_key = os.getenv('PRIVATE_KEY')

# Now, the private key is not embedded in the source code
```

### Step 2: Enable SSH Key Rotation

Regularly rotate SSH keys to reduce the impact of a key being compromised. There are commercial solutions available, for example, AWS Key Management Services, etc. 

### Step 3: Enable TLS for Server Communication

Use TLS in server communications to ensure data integrity and to authenticate servers. 

```bash
# Generate a new private key and certificate signing request
openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout domain.key -out domain.csr

# Generate a self-signed certificate for a specific domain
openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in domain.csr -signkey domain.key -out domain.crt

# Configure your server to use the TLS certificate for connections
server {
    listen              443 ssl;
    server_name         your_domain.com;
    ssl_certificate     /etc/ssl/certs/domain.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/private/domain.key;
}
```

### Step 4: Limit JWT Lifetime

To decrease the impact of a compromised JWT key, limit the lifetime of tokens. This can be done by setting appropriate values for "exp" (expiration time) claim in the token.

```python
import datetime
import jwt

payload = {
    'exp': datetime.datetime.utcnow() + datetime.timedelta(minutes=15),
    'iat': datetime.datetime.utcnow(),
    # More claims
}

jwt_token = jwt.encode(payload, private_key, algorithm='RS256')
```

### Step 5. Regular Audit and Update
Regularly audit the status of the keys and monitor the access logs. Understand the usage pattern to identify any anomalies. If a key is found to be compromised, act swiftly to revoke and replace the key.
