# Remediation for GRAPHQL_DOS_MULTI_VARIABLE_KEYS

## Remediation Steps for Denial of Service Test on GraphQL APIs

A denial of service (DoS) attack can cause considerable nuisance for a GraphQL API by excessively burdening the server infrastructure. This can occur particularly when there are multiple keys in a single variable object, causing an exponential growth in processing and resource requirements. Follow these steps to prevent a potential DoS attack.

### Step 1: Implement a Limit on Nested Queries

Consider a strict limit on the depth of queries that GraphQL can execute. Using a library like `graphql-depth-limit` for JavaScript, you can prevent unnecessarily nested queries:

```javascript
import depthLimit from 'graphql-depth-limit';
import express from 'express';
import graphqlHTTP from 'express-graphql';

const app = express();

app.use('/graphql', graphqlHTTP(async (request, response, graphQLParams) => {
  return {
    schema,
    validationRules: [depthLimit(5)]
  };
}));
```

Above, we have limited the query depth to five layers.

### Step 2: Use a Complexity-Based Solution

You can also use a complexity-based solution, assigning a "cost" to various fields and limiting the overall execution "cost". Use a library like `graphql-validation-complexity` to get this done:

```javascript
import {createComplexityLimitRule} from 'graphql-validation-complexity';
import express from 'express';
import graphqlHTTP from 'express-graphql';

const app = express();

app.use('/graphql', graphqlHTTP(async (request, response, graphQLParams) => {
  return {
    schema,
    validationRules: [createComplexityLimitRule(1000)]
  };
}));
```

### Step 3: Proactive Monitoring and Alerting

Establish robust monitoring and alerting tools to quickly detect unusual patterns of usage. 

### Step 4: Regular Auditing and Update

Keep your GraphQL libraries and supporting infrastructure up-to-date, and frequently test your APIs for potential vulnerabilities.
