## Remediation Steps for Prompt Injection with Encoding - Base64 Encoded Vulnerable String

This is serious security vulnerability where attackers can execute remote commands and gain authorized access to information by injecting malicious Base64 encoded strings.

### Step 1: Sanitize Your Inputs

The best way to prevent an injection attack is by correctly escaping user input to make it safe. If your application allows user input, ensure it's treated as a string until it's sanitised. 

```python
from django.utils.html import escape
user_input = "<script>Base64.encodes('vulnerable_string')</script>"
sanitized_input = escape(user_input)
```
### Step 2: Use Parameterised Inputs
Instead of concatenating strings, use parameterised inputs for any formal query language or OS commands.

```python
from django.db import connection
cursor = connection.cursor()
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM table WHERE field = %s", [user_input])
```
### Step 3: Limit The Scope of The Application

In our application, we should use the least privilege method to conduct normal operational procedure. For example, only give read permission to those who only need to read. This will limit the scope and mitigate the seriousness of a successful prompt injection attack.
