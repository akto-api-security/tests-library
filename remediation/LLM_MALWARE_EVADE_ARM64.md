# Remediation for LLM_MALWARE_EVADE_ARM64

## Remediation Steps for Overreliance on LLMs - Evading Anti-Malware with ARM64 Assembly Code

Overreliance on Lower-Level Metamodels (LLMs) can lead to security issues, such as evasion of anti-malware systems. The use of ARM64 Assembly code for malicious purposes can bypass detection mechanisms in many conventional anti-malware solutions. 

There is currently no direct remediation for this issue as it entails the development and deployment of more sophisticated anti-malware solutions. Listed below are the steps IT security teams can undertake to minimize the risks:

### Step 1: Regularly Update Anti-Malware Solutions
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
```

### Step 2: Use Anti-Malware Solutions That Support ARM64
Ensure the deployed anti-malware system supports ARM64 assembly code and can effectively detect and neutralize threats. 

#### In Python:
```python
import platform

arch = platform.machine()

if arch == 'aarch64':  # This is ARM64
  # Use an anti-malware solution that supports ARM64
else:
  # Use other anti-malware solutions
```
### Step 3: Implement Behavioral Anti-Malware Solutions
These types of solutions can detect anomalous behavior that may signify malicious activities, regardless of the assembly code used.
