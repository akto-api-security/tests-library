# Remediation for LLM_MALWARE_EVADE_ARM64

## Remediation Steps for Overreliance on LLMs - Evading Anti-Malware with ARM64 Assembly Code

Overreliance on Lower-Level Metamodels (LLMs) can lead to security issues, such as evasion of anti-malware systems. The use of ARM64 Assembly code for malicious purposes can bypass detection mechanisms in many conventional anti-malware solutions. 

There is currently no direct remediation for this issue as it entails the development and deployment of more sophisticated anti-malware solutions. Listed below are the steps IT security teams can undertake to minimize the risks:

### Step 1: Regularly Update Anti-Malware Solutions
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
```

### Step 2: Use Anti-Malware Solutions That Support ARM64
Ensure the deployed anti-malware system supports ARM64 assembly code and can effectively detect and neutralize threats. 

#### In Python:
```python
import platform

arch = platform.machine()

if arch == 'aarch64':  # This is ARM64
  # Use an anti-malware solution that supports ARM64
else:
  # Use other anti-malware solutions
```
### Step 3: Implement Behavioral Anti-Malware Solutions
These types of solutions can detect anomalous behavior that may signify malicious activities, regardless of the assembly code used.

### Step 4: Security Training and Awareness
Teach your development and operation teams about the security risks associated with overreliance on lower-level metamodels and the vulnerabilities of the ARM64 assembly code.

### Step 5: Regular Vulnerability Assessment and Audit
```bash
# Command depends on the vulnerability scanner used
vuln_scanner_command --scan --audit --fix
```

### Step 6: Partner with Experienced Cybersecurity Professionals
Work with a cybersecurity team who is knowledgeable and experienced in dealing with threats using different assembly codes including ARM64.

Although there is no direct fix for this particular vulnerability in the assembly code, implementing these steps will greatly help reduce the risk of exploitation. Regular updates, training, and strategic partnerships can help stay ahead of potential threats of this nature.
