## Remediation Steps for LFI in Headers for Linux

Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability in Headers on a Linux-based system allows an attacker to read files that the web server has access to. This could lead to sensitive information disclosure.

### Step 1: Input Validation

Input validation is a key step in mitigating LFI attacks. Ensure all user-provided input is properly sanitized and checked.

```python
import re

def sanitize_user_input(input):
    # Allow only alphanumeric characters
    input = re.sub(r'\W+', '', input)
    return input
```

### Step 2: Use Safe Functions 

Avoid functions that could be leveraged for LFI attacks, such as including or requiring files based on user input.

```python
#BAD
include $_GET['filename'];

#GOOD, with input sanitization
$filename = sanitize_user_input($_GET['filename']);
include 'safe_directory/' . $filename;
```
### Step 3: Limit File Permissions

Configure file permissions restrictively. Sensitive files that do not need to be accessed by the web server should be secured.

```bash
chmod 700 sensitive_file.txt
```
