# Remediation for LFI_IN_HEADERS_LINUX

## Remediation Steps for LFI in Headers for Linux

Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability in Headers on a Linux-based system allows an attacker to read files that the web server has access to. This could lead to sensitive information disclosure.

### Step 1: Input Validation

Input validation is a key step in mitigating LFI attacks. Ensure all user-provided input is properly sanitized and checked.

```python
import re

def sanitize_user_input(input):
    # Allow only alphanumeric characters
    input = re.sub(r'\W+', '', input)
    return input
```

### Step 2: Use Safe Functions 

Avoid functions that could be leveraged for LFI attacks, such as including or requiring files based on user input.

```python
#BAD
include $_GET['filename'];

#GOOD, with input sanitization
$filename = sanitize_user_input($_GET['filename']);
include 'safe_directory/' . $filename;
```
### Step 3: Limit File Permissions

Configure file permissions restrictively. Sensitive files that do not need to be accessed by the web server should be secured.

```bash
chmod 700 sensitive_file.txt
```

### Step 4: Keep your Systems Updated

Regularly update your systems to the latest version to help prevent LFI exploitation.

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
```

Note: These steps can limit the possibilities of a LFI attack but might not eliminate all risks. Depending on your specific situation, additional customized steps might be necessary. Always ensure that your security measures are up-to-date and consider soliciting professional consultation if needed.
