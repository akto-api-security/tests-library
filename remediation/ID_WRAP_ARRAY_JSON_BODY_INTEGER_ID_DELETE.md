## Remediation Steps for BOLA: Turning JSON Param into Integer Array 

Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA) is a critical API vulnerability where the attacker can manipulate object identifiers to gain unauthorized access to data. A common manifestation of BOLA can occur when a JSON parameter is turned into an Integer array leading to unauthorized DELETE method APIs. Here's how we can prevent that:

### Step 1: Validate User Input
Itâ€™s important to validate any user provided input in your code. Avoid assuming the client will send correctly formatted JSON parameters, check everything.

For example, in Python, use the `isinstance()` function:
```python
def validate_input(input):
    if isinstance(input, int):
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

### Step 2: Use Proper Authentication & Authorization Checks
Implement strict access controls and ensure only authorized users can access specific API end points.

In Node.js with Express.js, using middleware like passport.js could look like this:

```javascript
var express = require('express');
var passport = require('passport');
var router = express.Router();

router.delete('/api/delete', passport.authenticate('jwt', { session: false }), function(req, res){
    // Perform deletion
});
```

### Step 3: Limit API Response Data
Limit the amount of data returned by the API to only what is necessary, thus reducing the chance of exposing sensitive information.

### Step 4: Regular Audit and Update
Your dev team should regularly audit their code for security vulnerabilities, make updates as needed and stay aware of the latest security standards and best practices.

```bash
# Update your package dependencies
npm update
``` 
Remember, static code analysis tools and security audits are an essential part of the development cycle. Regular updates and patches help to keep your application secure.
