## Remediation Steps for User Agent Fuzzing
User Agent Fuzzing can introduce a security vulnerability by attempting to trick the server into revealing sensitive data or gain unauthorized access by passing various manipulated versions of the User Agent string in the HTTP request.

Although this type of attack is very difficult to completely eliminate due to the nature of HTTP requests, there are several steps one can take to mitigate the risk.

### Step 1: Input validation
Validate the User Agent string on the server side. Reject malformed or unusually long User Agent strings.   

```python
import re

def is_valid_user_agent(user_agent):
    # Simple regex to check if user agent is valid
    if re.match("^[a-zA-Z0-9/.;_() -]*$", user_agent) and len(user_agent) < 512:
        return True
    return False

request_user_agent = 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT)' # example user agent
if not is_valid_user_agent(request_user_agent):
    raise Exception('Invalid user agent')
```

### Step 2: Whitelist known good User Agents
In addition to rejecting the bad, another approach is to only accept the User Agents that you know are good. This reduces the freedom for attackers.

```python
known_good_agents = ['Mozilla/5.0', 'Googlebot'] # example known good agents

def is_known_user_agent(user_agent):
    for agent in known_good_agents:
        if user_agent.startswith(agent):
            return True
    return False

if not is_known_user_agent(request_user_agent):
    raise Exception('Unknown user agent')
```
