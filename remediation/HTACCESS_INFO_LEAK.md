# Remediation for HTACCESS_INFO_LEAK

## Remediation Steps for Htaccess Information Leak
A .htaccess information leak is a security issue where the server inadvertently serves the .htaccess file instead of processing it. This can expose confidential information like file locations, redirection rules and optionally, passwords. Here are the steps to remediate this issue:

### Step 1: Prevent Access to .htaccess Files
The easiest way to prevent .htaccess information leaks is to disallow access to these files from the webserver. This can be achieved by adding the following directive in your `httpd.conf` file or in the .htaccess file itself:
```apacheconf
<Files ~ "^\.ht">
    Order allow,deny
    Deny from all
    Satisfy All
</Files>
```

This directive tells the Apache server to deny access to any file that starts with ".ht".

### Step 2: Set Permissions
Make sure the permissions on your .htaccess file are set correctly. It should be readable by the user under which the web server is running, but not writable or readable by anyone else:

```bash
chmod 644 .htaccess
chown www-data:www-data .htaccess
```

### Step 3: Configure Server
Lastly, make sure you have the following directive set in your Apache configuration file to tell Apache to process .htaccess files:

```apacheconf
AllowOverride All
```

If your 'AllowOverride' directive is set to 'None', Apache will not process .htaccess files.

### Step 4: Regular Audit and Update
Regularly check your .htaccess files and server configuration to ensure the settings are correct and that .htaccess files are not inadvertently accessible.
```bash
find /var/www -name ".htaccess" -exec ls -l {} \;
```
The output of the above command will give you the locations and permissions of all the .htaccess files which can be audited.
