## Remediation Steps for SQL Server Reporting Services Remote Code Execution

SQL Server Reporting services (SSRS) remote code execution is a serious security issue where attackers may execute arbitrary malicious commands on a target system running SSRS.

### Step 1. Install Latest SSRS Update from Microsoft

The first step is to install the latest SSRS update. Microsoft regularly releases patches and updates to fix known vulnerabilities, including remote code execution in Reporting Services.

```bash
# Use Microsoft Update to install the latest updates.
# Enable Microsoft Update in Windows Update settings to receive these updates.
```

### Step 2: Enable or Disable Web Service Extensions

```bash
# Open IIS Manager.
# In the left pane, expand the current server, and then click Web Service Extensions.
# In the details pane, click ASP.NET v2.0.50727, and then click Allow to enable it. Or click Prohibit to disable it.
```

### Step 3: Regularly Audit and Update Your Database

Ensure your database is regularly audited and updated to the latest patches and security fixes from Microsoft. This can help minimize the risk of vulnerabilities.

```bash
# Use SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to update your database to the latest version.
```

### Step 4: Limit Access Permissions

Limit the access permissions to only those users who need it. This significantly reduces the risk of an unauthorized user gaining access.

```sql
-- Limit the access permissions to specific roles
GRANT EXECUTE ON [Schema].[Your_Stored_Procedure] TO [User_Or_Role]
```
