# Remediation for BOLA_ADD_CUSTOM_HEADER_INTEGER_ID

## Remediation Steps for Exploiting BOLA (Broken Object-Level Authorization) by Adding Custom Header with Integer IDs for Unauthorized Access

Broken Object-Level Authorization is a vulnerability that occurs when an API endpoint is unprotected and can directly access resources through user-supplied input. This issue can be resolved by implementing proper authorization checks for each user request.

Here are the recommended steps to fix this vulnerability:

### Step 1: Validate User Input

Make sure all user input is validated to prevent malicious data submission. For example, if you are using a language like Node.js, you can use middleware such as express-validator to perform this check.

```javascript
const { check } = require('express-validator');

app.post('/api/resource', [
  check('userId').isInt(),
  // other checks...
], (req, res) => {
  // handle request...
});
```

### Step 2: Implement Object-Level Authorization

Check if a user has the required permission to access the resource. 

A good way to handle this is by using middleware to check each API request before it's processed. Here's a very simple example of how you might do this in Node.js using Express:

```javascript
function ensureAuthorized(req, res, next) {
  if (!req.user || req.user.id !== req.params.userId) {
    return res.status(403).send('Unauthorized');
  }

  next();
}

app.get('/api/resource/:userId', ensureAuthorized, (req, res) => {
  // handle request...
});
```

### Step 3: Implement Proper Error Handling

Ensure that your server responses do not expose sensitive information. It's especially important to hide server error details that could expose your database structure or query details.

```javascript
app.use(function (err, req, res, next) {
  console.error(err.stack)
  res.status(500).send('An error occurred, our technical team has been notified.')
})
```

### Step 4: Regular Audit and Update

Regularly check for updates and patches in your API framework and dependencies. Patch any available updates immediately to prevent the exploitation of known vulnerabilities.
