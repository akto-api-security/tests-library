# Remediation for ID_WRAP_ARRAY_OF_PARAMS_JSON_BODY_INTEGER_VAL_DELETE

## Remediation Steps for BOLA: Turning JSON Param into Array of Params with Integer

'BOLA' or 'Broken Object Level Authorization' is a serious security flaw which can lead to unauthorized access. This happens when an API endpoint is vulnerable and uses IDs to access objects directly. Here, we will focus on tackling a situation where a JSON parameter is converted into an array of parameters with integer values, causing unauthorized access with DELETE method APIs.

### Step 1: Validate User Roles

Always validate the user role before performing any operation on the database. Only authorized users should be allowed to call the DELETE API.

```java
if (user.getRole().equals("authorized_user_role")) {
    repository.deleteById(id);
} else {
    throw new UnauthorizedException();
}
```

### Step 2: Strong Validation on Input Parameters
Before accepting input from the user, make sure you are validating the parameters rigorously. Array input should not be accepted when only a single integer parameter is required. 

```java
if (!(input instanceof Integer)) {
    throw new BadRequestException("Invalid parameter");
}
```

### Step 3: Use Object's Ownership
Always verify whether the logged-in user is the owner of the object before modifying or deleting it.

```java
Optional<User> user = userRepository.findById(userId);
if (!user.get().getId().equals(id)) {
    throw new UnauthorizedException();
}
```

### Step 4: Implement Rate Limiting
To protect the API from brute force attacks, add rate limiting to your API. This will limit the number of API calls from a single user in a specific timeframe.

```bash
    # implementing rate limiting in Nginx
    limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=api:10m rate=10r/m;
```

### Step 5: Regular Audit and Update
Ensure regular audits of your API to identify and remediate any future vulnerabilities. Regularly update yourself with information on recent vulnerabilities and update your API accordingly. 

```bash
# restart your server after making changes
sudo service servername restart
```
