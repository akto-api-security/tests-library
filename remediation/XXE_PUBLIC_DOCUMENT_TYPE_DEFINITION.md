# Remediation for XXE_PUBLIC_DOCUMENT_TYPE_DEFINITION

## Remediation Steps for XML External Entity (XXE) Vulnerability
XML External Entity (XXE) refers to vulnerabilities that exploit applications processing XML inputs from untrusted sources. These exploits can lead to the disclosure of internal files in the server, denial of service, port scanning from the perspective of the machine, and other system impacts.

Here are the remediation steps to secure API endpoints:

### Step 1: Disable XML External Entity Processing in the Parser Configuration
In most XML parsers, you can disable DTDs (Document Type Definitions) which consequently disables XXE. Here's an example code snippet for Java:

```java
DocumentBuilderFactory dbf = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();
dbf.setExpandEntityReferences(false);
```

### Step 2: Use Less Complex Data Formats
It's best to avoid serialization of sensitive data. Alternatives to XML like JSON, Protocol Buffers, and so on, can be used.

### Step 3: Use XML Schema or DTD for Validation
You can include an XML schema in your input validation strategy to ensure only valid inputs are accepted by your service. This will prevent malicious users from injecting harmful XML entities into the input.

```java
SchemaFactory sf = SchemaFactory.newInstance(XMLConstants.W3C_XML_SCHEMA_NS_URI);
Schema schema = sf.newSchema(new File("./schema.xsd"));

DocumentBuilderFactory dbf = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();
dbf.setSchema(schema);
``` 

### Step 4: Update XML Processing Libraries
Ensure that you use the most recent, up-to-date XML processing libraries as they are more likely to contain patches for vulnerabilities like this.

### Step 5: Regular Audit and Update
On a quarterly basis, perform an audit of your system, making sure that any and all security measures are kept up to date and work as expected. Regularly updating your system and libraries ensures you stay one step ahead of potential security vulnerabilities.
