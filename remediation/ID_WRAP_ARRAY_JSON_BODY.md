## Remediation Steps for BOLA: Turning JSON Param into Array for Unauthorized Access

BOLA, or Broken Object Level Authorization, exploits occur when an application fails to verify the user's access rights before granting access to data. In the case of turning a JSON parameter into an array for unauthorized access, we can take certain remediation steps.

### Step 1: Implement Proper Access Control
Firstly, make sure that appropriate access control methods are in place. Here's an example in Node.js, using Access Control List (ACL).

```javascript
const AccessControl = require("accesscontrol");
const ac = new AccessControl();

ac.grant('guest')                    
    .readOwn('profile')               
    .updateOwn('profile')              
ac.grant('admin')                     
    .extend('guest')                  
    .readAny('profile')                
    .deleteAny('profile')             
```
In this example, the 'guest' role can only read and update its own profile while the 'admin' role can read and delete any profile.

### Step 2: Validate Input
Never trust user input. Always validate and sanitize user input to make sure it cannot manipulate the behaviour of the system. Here is an example using express-validator middleware in a Node.js express application:

```javascript
const { body } = require('express-validator/check');

app.post('/', [
  body('jsonParam').isArray()
], (req, res, next) => {
  // handle request
});
```
In this example, the JSON parameter 'jsonParam' is checked to ensure it's an array.

### Step 3: Regular Audit and Update
Always maintain regular audits of your application and ensure to update your system with latest patches and updates.

```bash
npm outdated
npm update
```

In these steps, `npm outdated` will show you all the outdated packages, and `npm update` will update all the packages to their latest version, thus incorporating any new security patches and updates.

By following these steps, you can ensure a secure application that is mitigated against BOLA attacks related to turning a JSON parameter into an array.
