# Remediation for SENSITIVE_DATA_EXPOSURE_OPENVPN_DOMAIN

## Remediation Steps for Sensitive Data Exposure in OPENVPN DOMAIN

Sensitive data exposure on an OPENVPN domain is a serious security vulnerability. To prevent this, access to sensitive data should be regulated with the use of strong encryption and secure configurations.

### Step 1: Enable TLS Authentication

In OpenVPN, data communications can be secured by enabling TLS authentication.

```bash
openvpn --genkey --secret ta.key
```

This will generate a shared secret key. Note that the secret key should be generated on a secure system and moved securely to your client and server machines.

```bash
openvpn --tls-server --dh dh2048.pem --ca ca.crt --cert server.crt --key server.key --tls-auth ta.key
openvpn --tls-client --dh dh2048.pem --ca ca.crt --cert client.crt --key client.key --tls-auth ta.key
```

In these two command lines, we're launching the OpenVPN on server and client sides with TLS and the previously generated key.

### Step 2: Secure User/Group Permissions

Ensure OpenVPN service is running as a non-root user and group. Below is an example of an OpenVPN server configuration file.

```bash
user openvpn
group openvpn
```

### Step 3: Enable Cipher Algorithms

Make sure to enable secure cipher algorithms for encryption and message authentication. Below is an example:

```bash
cipher AES-256-CBC
auth SHA256
```
