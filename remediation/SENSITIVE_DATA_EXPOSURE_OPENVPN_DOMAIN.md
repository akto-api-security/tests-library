# Remediation for SENSITIVE_DATA_EXPOSURE_OPENVPN_DOMAIN

## Remediation Steps for Sensitive Data Exposure in OPENVPN DOMAIN

Sensitive data exposure on an OPENVPN domain is a serious security vulnerability. To prevent this, access to sensitive data should be regulated with the use of strong encryption and secure configurations.

### Step 1: Enable TLS Authentication

In OpenVPN, data communications can be secured by enabling TLS authentication.

```bash
openvpn --genkey --secret ta.key
```

This will generate a shared secret key. Note that the secret key should be generated on a secure system and moved securely to your client and server machines.

```bash
openvpn --tls-server --dh dh2048.pem --ca ca.crt --cert server.crt --key server.key --tls-auth ta.key
openvpn --tls-client --dh dh2048.pem --ca ca.crt --cert client.crt --key client.key --tls-auth ta.key
```

In these two command lines, we're launching the OpenVPN on server and client sides with TLS and the previously generated key.

### Step 2: Secure User/Group Permissions

Ensure OpenVPN service is running as a non-root user and group. Below is an example of an OpenVPN server configuration file.

```bash
user openvpn
group openvpn
```

### Step 3: Enable Cipher Algorithms

Make sure to enable secure cipher algorithms for encryption and message authentication. Below is an example:

```bash
cipher AES-256-CBC
auth SHA256
```

### Step 4: Regular Update and Audit

Regularly update your OpenVPN to the latest version in order to benefit from the latest security patches. Also, conduct security audits periodically to detect any vulnerabilities.

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade openvpn
```

These steps should help in considerably reducing the risk of sensitive data exposure on your OpenVPN domain. Every setup is unique, so additional steps might be needed depending on your configuration.
