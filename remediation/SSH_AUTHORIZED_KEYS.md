## Remediation Steps for SSH Authorized Keys

SSH Authorized Keys vulnerability is a critical issue associated with improper key management. If attackers gain access to the authorized keys, they might gain unauthorized access to the SSH server.

### Step 1: Remove All Unauthorized SSH Keys
Review all SSH keys and remove any unfamiliar keys. But, before deleting any keys, ensure that access to your server isn't lost.

```bash
cd ~/.ssh
ls -l
```

The `ls -l` command lists the SSH keys present in the directory.

```bash
rm authorized_keys
```

The `rm` command removes the specified file.

### Step 2: Set Strong SSH Keys
Always use strong SSH keys to reduce the risk of brute force attacks.

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
```

The `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096` command generates a new 4096-bit RSA SSH key pair.

### Step 3: Restrict SSH Key Permissions
Restrict access to your SSH key pair.

```bash
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

The `chmod 600` command changes permissions to be read and write for only the owner.

### Step 4: Copy Authorized Keys
Copy the public key (id_rsa.pub) into the authorized_keys file.

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```
