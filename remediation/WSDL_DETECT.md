## Remediation Steps for WSDL File Exposure
WSDL (Web Services Description Language) file exposure can be a serious security issue. If the WSDL file is exposed, it could potentially allow attackers to discover the services that the system exposes which might lead to unauthorized actions or information exposure.

### Step 1: Restrict access to the WSDL file

You can restrict access to the WSDL file using `.htaccess` file in Apache servers.

Your `.htaccess` file should look something like this:

```bash
<Files ~ "\.wsdl$">
	Order deny,allow
	Deny from all
	Allow from 192.0.2.0/24
</Files>
```

In the above code, replace `192.0.2.0/24` with the IP range that should have access to the WSDL file.

### Step 2: Remove WSDL file from the server

If the WSDL file is not necessary, consider removing it from the server altogether. Before doing this, ensure the file is not in use or required by any services. 

```bash
rm /path/to/your.wsdl
```

### Step 3: Avoid unnecessary exposure of services

Use scopes to protect your services if they do not need to be exposed. 

In Java, using Spring framework:

```java
@Service
@Scope("singleton")
public class YourService {
    // your code here
}
```
