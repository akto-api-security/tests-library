## Remediation Steps for JWT Token Tampering: Modifying User IDs for Unauthorized Access

JWT Token tampering is a severe security issue. Attackers might modify user IDs within JWT Tokens to gain unauthorized access. Here is how to rectify this issue:

### Step 1: Validate Payload

Always validate the payload of a JWT Token. This includes checking the issuer, audience, and signature of the token.

```python
from jwt import decode, InvalidTokenError

def validate_token(token, secret, algorithms=['HS256']):
    try:
        payload = decode(token, secret, algorithms=algorithms)
    except InvalidTokenError:
        return False, 'Invalid token'
    
    # check issuer, audience, and more if necessary
    issuer = payload['iss']
    audience = payload['aud']
    
    if issuer != 'expected_issuer' or audience != 'expected_audience':
        return False, 'Invalid issuer or audience'
    
    return True, 'Valid token'
```

### Step 2: Encrypt JWT Token

If JWT Tokens must be stored on the client-side, be sure to encrypt the tokens.

```python
from jwt import encode

def encrypt_token(payload, secret, algorithm='HS256'):
    return encode(payload, secret, algorithm=algorithm)
```

### Step 3: Use HTTPS 

Make sure all communications are made over HTTPS to prevent the token from being intercepted during transit.

```bash
# In the Apache server configuration
<VirtualHost *:80>
   ServerName www.example.com
   Redirect permanent / https://www.example.com/
</VirtualHost>
```

### Step 4: Set HTTP Only Cookies

Store JWT in HTTP only cookies to prevent XSS attacks as this makes JavaScript unable to access the cookies.

```python
from http.cookies import SimpleCookie

cookie = SimpleCookie()
cookie["jwt"] = jwt_token
cookie["jwt"]["httponly"] = True
```

### Step 5: Regular Auditing and Updating

Keep the system and its dependencies up to date. Regularly review the code base to identify and address new security threats. 

```bash
# Using apt-get for updating the system
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
```
