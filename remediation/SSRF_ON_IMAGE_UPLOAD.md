# Remediation for SSRF_ON_IMAGE_UPLOAD

## Remediation Steps for Sensitive AWS details exposed via replacing image param due to SSRF
Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks are a way to carry out actions on behalf of the server. This becomes a serious security issue when sensitive details such as AWS credentials are exposed.

### Step 1: Implement Input Validation
Input validation is a proactive way to prevent SSRF attacks. It verifies and sanitizes the user input to ensure it is safe before processing it. We can use a server-side language like Python for this:
```python
import re
# assuming 'url' is the input parameter where user provides the url
user_url = input("Enter the url: ")
# validate the user input using a Whitelist approach, here we're allowing only urls of 'my-domain.com'
if re.match(r'https?://([\w-]+\.)?my-domain\.com(/[\w- ./?%&=]*)?', user_url):
    # process the url
else:
    print("Invalid URL")
```
### Step 2: Restrict Outbound Traffic 
In case of AWS specifically, you need to restrict outbound traffic and limit which ports and IPs your application can communicate with.
```bash
# Use AWS Security Group to limit outbound traffic
aws ec2 authorize-security-group-egress --group-id sg-903004f8 --ip-permissions IpProtocol=tcp,FromPort=22,ToPort=22,IpRanges=[{CidrIp=0.0.0.0/0}]
aws ec2 revoke-security-group-egress --group-id sg-903004f8 --protocol tcp --port 22 --cidr 0.0.0.0/0
```
### Step 3: Least Privilege AWS IAM roles and policies
Ensure that the AWS IAM roles and policies attached to your resources follow the principle of least privilege, meaning they should have only the necessary permissions required to function.
```bash
# Create a new policy with restricted permissions
aws iam create-policy --policy-name MyLimitedPolicy --policy-document file://limited-policy.json

# Create a new role which uses the new policy
aws iam create-role --role-name MyLimitedRole --assume-role-policy-document file://trust-policy.json --description "A role with restricted permissions."

# Attach the policy to the role
aws iam attach-role-policy --role-name MyLimitedRole --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:policy/MyLimitedPolicy
```
### Step 4: Regular audit and update
Regularly audit your servers and applications for any vulnerabilities or exposed sensitive details and keep all servers, libraries and applications updated.

Remember, input validation and limiting server functionality (block outbound traffic, least privilege roles etc) are the most effective ways to prevent SSRF attacks.
