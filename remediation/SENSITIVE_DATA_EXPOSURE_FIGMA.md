## Remediation Steps for Sensitive Data Exposure in Figma

Sensitive data exposure is a serious security issue. Figma files are private by default, but can be shared with other users or made public. Ensuring your data is protected always comes down to proper access management.

Given that Figma is a Software as a Service (SaaS) product, most remediation steps involve practices to ensure sensitive data isn't exposed rather than modifying any source code.

### Step 1: Check User Access

It's important to routinely check who has access to your Figma files and projects. This is especially critical when using the commenting feature, as comments may contain sensitive information that shouldn't be exposed to everyone. 

If you notice an unauthorized user, you can remove their access by navigating to the share settings and removing them. Remember, only give 'edit' permissions to users who absolutely need it.

### Step 2: Be Mindful of Public Files and Projects

Avoid making Figma files or projects public, especially if they contain sensitive information. Always double-check the visibility of your files and projects by going to Figma's sharing settings. If a Figma file or project must be made public, ensure it does not contain any sensitive data.

### Step 3: Use Private Comments

Figma allows for private commenting, making sure only certain people can view these comments. Utilizing this feature can be effective in preventing the exposure of sensitive data embedded in comments.

In conclusion, remediation consists mainly of the right usage practices and diligent access oversight. There is no source code involved as Figma is a SaaS application.
