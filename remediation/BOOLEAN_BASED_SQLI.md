# Remediation for BOOLEAN_BASED_SQLI

## Remediation Steps for Boolean Based SQL Injection on Login Endpoints

Boolean based SQL Injection on login endpoints is a severe security issue. Attackers can use this vulnerability to inject malicious SQL code into your app, potentially gaining unauthorized access to sensitive data. 

### Step 1: Use Prepared Statements
The best way to prevent SQL injection is to use Prepared Statements (with Parameterized Queries). These ensure that an attacker cannot change the intent of a query even if SQL statements are inserted.

Here's an example in Java using JDBC:

```java
String user = request.getParameter("user");
String pass = request.getParameter("pass");
   
String query = "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?";

PreparedStatement stmt = connection.prepareStatement(query);
stmt.setString(1, user);
stmt.setString(2, pass);

ResultSet results = stmt.executeQuery();
```

### Step 2: Apply Input Validation 
Input data should always be validated before used. This includes applying restrictions on input such as length (max/min), type, format, consistency and range.

```java
if (user.length() > 20 || user.isEmpty() || pass.length() > 30 || pass.isEmpty()) {
    throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid input");
}
```

### Step 3: Update and Patch Regularly
Ensure your development platforms and languages are regularly updated and patched. Many security issues are fixed in updates and patches from software providers.

### Step 4: Employ Web Application Firewall (WAF)

A Web Application Firewall could help to filter out malicious data. It can identify and remove, not only SQLi, but other type of attack vectors.

### Step 5: Least Privilege Principle
Ensure database user accounts have the least amount of privileges necessary to carry out their job. This will limit potential damage should an account be compromised.

### Step 6: Regular Code Review
Regularly review code for potentially insecure coding practices. Automated security scanning tools can also be used in addition to manual reviews.
