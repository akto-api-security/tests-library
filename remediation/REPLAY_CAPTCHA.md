## Remediation Steps for Replaying Request With Same Captcha

Replaying a request with the same CAPTCHA is a serious security issue. This vulnerability is often exploited to bypass CAPTCHA checks and gain unauthorized access. To mitigate this, we can store the CAPTCHA token/user combination and ensure that each CAPTCHA can only be validated once.

### Step 1: Store Token/User Combination

First, store CAPTCHA token along with the User ID or Session ID to keep track of used captchas. 

```python
class Captcha(models.Model):
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    captcha_token = models.CharField(max_length=255)
```

### Step 2: Check CAPTCHA Token Validity

During validation, check if the CAPTCHA token was already used by the user. If it was, do not allow the request to proceed. 

```python
def validate_captcha(captcha_token, user_id):
    try:
        used_captcha = Captcha.objects.get(captcha_token=captcha_token, user__id=user_id)
    except Captcha.DoesNotExist:
        return True # Allowed, CAPTCHA token not used yet
    return False # Not allowed, CAPTCHA token already used
```

### Step 3: Mark CAPTCHA Token After Use

Once the CAPTCHA token has been validated for a user, mark it as used so that it cannot be used again.

```python
def mark_captcha_as_used(captcha_token, user_id):
    used_captcha = Captcha.objects.create(captcha_token=captcha_token, user_id=user_id)
    used_captcha.save()
```

### Step 4: Enforce Above Steps

The above methods should be enforced in the program flow. For example, upon receiving a request, validate the CAPTCHA, and if it's valid, mark it as used.

```python
from django.http import JsonResponse
def process_request(request):
    captcha_token = request.POST.get('captcha_token')
    user_id = request.user.id # Assuming user is authenticated and available
    
    is_captcha_valid = validate_captcha(captcha_token, user_id)
    if not is_captcha_valid:
        return JsonResponse({"error": "Invalid or used CAPTCHA"}, status=400)
    
    mark_captcha_as_used(captcha_token, user_id)
    
    # Process request...
    # ...
```

This example is shown in Python using the Django framework, but the concept can be adapted to any language or framework.
