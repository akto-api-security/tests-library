# Remediation for SQLI_ERROR_BASED_PARAM_ORACLE

## Remediation Steps for Error Based SQL Injection in Oracle

SQL Injection is a critical security issue. If input parameters are not properly sanitized, an attacker may execute arbitrary SQL code, effectively compromising the database and the application.

### Step 1: Use Prepared Statements
By using prepared statements or parameterized queries, we are forcing the database to treat data inputs as data rather than part of the SQL command. Here is an example in Java:
```java
String selectSQL = "SELECT USERNAME FROM USERS WHERE ID = ?";
PreparedStatement preparedStatement = dbConnection.prepareStatement(selectSQL);
preparedStatement.setInt(1, 1001);
ResultSet rs = preparedStatement.executeQuery();
```

### Step 2: Use an ORM Framework
ORM technologies, like Hibernate or Entity Framework, effectively avoid SQL Injection by default. These frameworks generate parameterized queries behind the scenes.

### Step 3: Validate and Sanitize User Inputs
Ensure that the length, format, type, and range of input always conform to expected values.
```java
public boolean validateInput(String input) {
    return (input != null) && (input.matches("[A-Za-z0-9_]+"));
}
```

### Step 4: Use Least Privileged Database Accounts
Only allow the minimum permissions necessary for the application to function. This might prevent more serious damage if an SQL injection attack is successful.

### Step 5: Regular Code Review and Use of Security Scanners
Make regular audits of your codebase and use automated security checkers, which can catch SQL injections and other security vulnerabilities.
