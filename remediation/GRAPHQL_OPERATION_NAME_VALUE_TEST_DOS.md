# Remediation for GRAPHQL_OPERATION_NAME_VALUE_TEST_DOS

## Remediation Steps for Denial of Service Test on GraphQL API 
Denial of Service attacks on a GraphQL API can bring your service to its knees. This particular issue is triggered by passing special characters in the `Operation Name` field. By properly validating and sanitizing inputs, you can mitigate this threat. 

### Step 1: Input Validation
Make sure all inputs are validated before processing. You can achieve this by integrating a library such as `graphql-depth-limit` or `express-graphql` into your code base. 

```javascript
const depthLimit = require('graphql-depth-limit')

app.use('/graphql', expressGraphQL(req => ({
  schema,
  validationRules: [
    depthLimit(
      4,
      { ignore: [/_trusted$/, 'idontcare'] },
      depths => console.log(depths)
    )
  ]
})))
```

### Step 2: Special Character Removal
You can use a Regex to match and remove any special characters in the Operation Name parameter. Here's an example:

```javascript
const operationName = "!@#$%^&*(){}:;<>?|";
const sanitizedOperationName = operationName.replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9]/g, "");
console.log(sanitizedOperationName); // Prints out empty string since operationName was all special characters
```

### Step 3: Rate Limiting
Implement rate limiting to prevent the burst of requests from a potentially malicious client. This can be achieved by using a library like `express-rate-limit`.

```javascript
const rateLimit = require("express-rate-limit");

const apiLimiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 100
});

app.use("/graphql", apiLimiter);
```
