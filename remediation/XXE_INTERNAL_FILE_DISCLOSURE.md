## Remediation Steps for XML External Entity (XXE) File Disclosure Vulnerability 

XML External Entity (XXE) exploits can allow an attacker to interact with any file accessible by the application. In particular, XXE can be used to:
- Read internal files;
- Interact with internal systems; 
- Execute a remote request from the server;
- Denial of Service (DoS);
- Pull up and parse XML, server-side instead of client-side.
Here are ways to prevent that:

### Step 1: Disable XML External Entity Processing

In Java, disable DTDs (External Entities) completely in your XML Validator factory. Here's how to do it:

```java
DocumentBuilderFactory dbf = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();
String FEATURE;

try {
    // This is the PRIMARY defense. If DTDs (doctypes) are disallowed, almost all 
    // XML entity attacks are prevented
    FEATURE = "http://apache.org/xml/features/disallow-doctype-decl";
    dbf.setFeature(FEATURE, true);

    // if you can't completely disable DTDs, then at least do the following:
    FEATURE = "http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities";
    dbf.setFeature(FEATURE, false);

    FEATURE = "http://xml.org/sax/features/external-parameter-entities";
    dbf.setFeature(FEATURE, false);

    dbf.setXIncludeAware(false);
    dbf.setExpandEntityReferences(false);
} 
catch (ParserConfigurationException e) {
    // Handle Exception
}
```
### Step 2: Use Less Complex Data Formats

Where possible, consider using less complex data formats such as JSON, and avoiding serialization of sensitive data.

### Step 3: Patch or Upgrade

Patch or upgrade all XML processors and libraries in use by the application or on the underlying operating system. Use dependency checkers to manage this process.
