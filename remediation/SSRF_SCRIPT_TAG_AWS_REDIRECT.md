# Remediation for SSRF_SCRIPT_TAG_AWS_REDIRECT

## Remediation Steps for SSRF Test Via Replacing Parameters with Script Tags

Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) test via replacing parameters with script tags containing redirect URLs for AWS internal URL is a serious security issue. Attackers can abuse it to perform actions on behalf of the server, effectively compromising the system. Following are the recommended remediation steps:

### Step 1: Validate Input
The first step is to ensure that the input is properly validated. It is recommended to use a proper system that helps to validate, filter and sanitize the user input. It could be a standardized input validation method or a specific system designed to prevent SSRF attacks. 

```java
String userInput = request.getParameter("input");
// Using OWASP Java Encoder project to encode the userInput
String safeInput = Encode.forHtmlContent(userInput);
```

### Step 2: Block Unsafe Protocols
Blocking unsafe protocols like `file://` will help prevent a significant number of SSRF attacks.

```java
URL url = new URL(userInput);
if (!"http".equals(url.getProtocol()) && !"https".equals(url.getProtocol())) {
    throw new IllegalArgumentException("Unsafe protocol");
}
```

### Step 3: Use a Safe Redirect Logic
Instead of allowing the user to input any redirect URL, use a system where the user can only choose from safe URLs.

```java
String redirectURL = getSafeRedirectURL(request.getParameter("redirect_choice"));
response.sendRedirect(redirectURL);
```

### Step 4: Use Firewall
Limit the server's ability to initiate outbound connections only to necessary IPs/ports.

### Step 5: Regular Security Review
Regular auditing and updating of the system with secure measures to keep up with potential new threats and rectify vulnerabilities.
```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
```
These steps will be effective in mitigating SSRF attacks associated with replacing parameters with script tags containing redirect URLs for AWS internal URLs.
