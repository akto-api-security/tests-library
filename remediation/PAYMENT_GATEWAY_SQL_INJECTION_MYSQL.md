# Remediation for PAYMENT_GATEWAY_SQL_INJECTION_MYSQL

## Remediation Steps for SQL Injection on Payment Gateway API

SQL Injection on a Payment Gateway API to MySQL can lead to serious security vulnerabilities. The attacker could obtain sensitive user data, manipulate transactions, and even gain unauthorized control over the entire database. 
Here are the remediation steps for this issue:

### Step 1: Use Parameterized Queries
Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements to ensure that user input is never directly incorporated into a SQL statement. 

In Python, using MySQL Connector:

```python
import mysql.connector
cnx = mysql.connector.connect(user='<user>', password='<password>', database='<database>')
cursor = cnx.cursor()
stmt = (
  "SELECT FROM users WHERE username = %s AND password = %s"
)
data = (username, password)
cursor.execute(stmt, data)
```

### Step 2: Input Validation
Use strict input validation for form inputs and wherever else user-provided data is accepted. 

```python
from django.core.exceptions import ValidationError
def validate_username(value):
    if not value.isalnum():
        raise ValidationError('Invalid username - use only letters and numbers')
```

### Step 3: Use Least Privilege Principle
SQL accounts used by the application should have the least privileges necessary to perform their function.

```sql
CREATE USER 'newuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON database_name.table_name TO 'newuser'@'localhost';
```

### Step 4: Regular Update and Patching
Always ensure your software, including application server, web server, database server, and APIs, is up to date.

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
```
### Step 5: Security Testing and Review
Use regular vulnerability scanning and penetration testing to ensure your defenses are sufficient.

```bash
openvas-start

```
