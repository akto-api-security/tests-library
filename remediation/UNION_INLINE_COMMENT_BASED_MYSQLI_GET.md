# Remediation for UNION_INLINE_COMMENT_BASED_MYSQLI_GET

## Remediation Steps for Union-Based SQL Injection Test with Inline Comments for MySQL on GET Method APIs

This type of SQL injection testing involves manipulating SQL queries for illegitimate purposes. Without proper precautions, attackers can easily exploit this vulnerability to extract sensitive database information.

Correcting this issue involves validating user input, using parameterized queries, or leveraging ORM frameworks.

### Step 1: Validate User Input

Always ensure to sanitize and validate user input to protect against SQL Injection attacks. For example, confirming that numeric values are indeed numeric prevents unauthorized SQL queries from executing.

```python
from flask import request

def validate_input(value):
    if not value.isnumeric():
        return False
    return True

@app.route('/', methods=['GET'])
def get_data():
    user_input = request.args.get('input')
    if validate_input(user_input):
        # Continue processing
        pass
```
### Step 2: Use Parameterized Queries

Parameterized queries ensure that the parameters (i.e., inputs supplied by users) are treated strictly as data and not as part of the SQL command. Here's how to do it in PHP:

```php
$pdo = new PDO('mysql:host=localhost;dbname=database', 'username', 'password');
$stmt = $pdo->prepare('SELECT * FROM table WHERE column = :value');
$stmt->execute(['value' => $userInput]);
```

### Step 3: Use ORM Frameworks

Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) frameworks can considerably reduce the risk of SQL Injection by promoting the use of parameterized queries and escaping of user-supplied input. Here is an example using Django's ORM:

```python
from django.shortcuts import get_object_or_404
from myapp.models import MyModel

def my_view(request, value):
    my_object = get_object_or_404(MyModel, pk=value)
    # further processing...
```

### Step 4: Regular Audit and Update

Regularly checking your application for any possible vulnerabilities and updating your systems accordingly is a good cybersecurity practice that can help protect against SQL injection attacks.

```bash
# Regular system and software updates
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade

# Using an automated security tool for vulnerability scanning can be beneficial
sudo w3af_gui
```
