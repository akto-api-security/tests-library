## Remediation Steps for BOLA with PATCH/PUT APIs
Exploiting a Broken Object-Level Authorization (BOLA) by inserting Special Characters in URL path is a security vulnerability where attackers can bypass authorization and perform operations on resources they don't actually own. These operations could be carried out through PATCH/PUT APIs.
### Step 1: Whitelist Characters/Strings
To start with, only allow specific safe characters (a whitelist) in the path of the URL. 
```java
//Java Code
String safePath = request.getServletPath();
if (!safePath.matches("[a-zA-Z0-9_/\\.-]*")) {
    throw new IllegalStateException("Detected potential path manipulation attack");
}
```
### Step 2: Implement Proper Authorization
Ensure that the API has proper authorization checks in place before processing a request. Always verify that the authenticated user has necessary permissions to perform operations on the requested resource.
```java
//Java Code
boolean hasPermission = permissionService.checkUserPermission(user, resource);
if (!hasPermission) {
    throw new SecurityException("User does not have the necessary permissions for the resource.");
}
```
### Step 3: Implement Proper Input Validation
Always validate user inputs on server side. Avoid direct object references whenever possible, implement indirect references instead. Check the length and pattern of query parameters and request body.
```java
//Java Code
if(input.length() > MAX_LENGTH || !input.matches("[a-zA-Z0-9]*")) {
    throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid input.");
}
```
