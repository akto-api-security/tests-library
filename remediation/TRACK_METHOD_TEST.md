## Remediation Steps for TRACK Method Vulnerability Test
The TRACK method vulnerability can put the security of your web server at risk by allowing potential attackers to intercept HTTP requests. Therefore, it is crucial to disable the TRACE and TRACK methods to minimize this risk.

### Step 1: Disable TRACE and TRACK methods in Apache HTTP Server
If you are using Apache as your web server, follow the below steps.
To disable these methods, you should modify the configuration file.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
```

Then add the following directive inside the main `<Directory>` section.

```apache
TraceEnable off
```

Save your changes and exit the text editor when youâ€™re done.

### Step 2: Restart the Apache HTTP Server

Restart your Apache server to apply the changes.

```bash
sudo systemctl restart httpd
```

### Step 3: Confirm that TRACK and TRACE are disabled

You can use the `curl` command to check that the TRACE and TRACK methods are disabled. If they are, your server should return a `405 Method Not Allowed` response.

```bash
curl -vX TRACK http://yourwebsite.com
curl -vX TRACE http://yourwebsite.com
```

### Step 4: Repeat for All Subdomains

Work through steps 1-3 for all subdomains to ensure complete protection.

**Note:** Specifics may vary based on your Linux distribution, web server software, and server configuration. Make sure to adapt these steps to fit your particular setup. If your server software differs from Apache, refer to the specific documentation for disabling methods. If you are not using Apache as your server, then you would have to refer to the relevant documentation for your specific server.

If your server is behind a reverse proxy, you may need to disable the TRACE and TRACK methods on the proxy. Again, refer to the specific documentation for your proxy server. If your server software does not support disabling these methods directly, you may need to implement changes at the network level, perhaps on a firewall or a reverse proxy.

If you cannot disable these methods in your server or proxy, consider using a web application firewall that supports blocking these methods.
