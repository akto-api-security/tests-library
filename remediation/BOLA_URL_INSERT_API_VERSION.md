# Remediation for BOLA_URL_INSERT_API_VERSION

## Remediation Steps for Exploiting BOLA by inserting API Version IDs in URL path for Unauthorized Access
BOLA (a.k.a Broken Object Level Authorization) vulnerability can allow an attacker to substitute API version IDs in the URL path, bypassing restrictions and gaining unauthorized access to sensitive data.

### Step 1: Validate APIs Access Control
Validation should be based on the user request. Ensure that a user can only request a unique ID that they should have access to.

For instance, if you're using a Node.js application, verify the access control as shown below:

```javascript
app.get('/api/version/:versionId', function(req, res) {
    let versionId = req.params.versionId;
    /* ... Fail if the versionId does not belong to the authenticated user ... */
    /* ... Generate error 403 if failed to validate ... */
});
```
### Step 2: Avoid Direct Object References
Use indirect object references. Rather than using the actual ID of an object, replace it with another value which can be mapped server-side to the associated ID. 

For example:

```python
from django.shortcuts import get_object_or_404
def api_version(request, user_version_id):
    version = get_object_or_404(UserVersion, user=user, id=user_version_id)
    # remaining code...
```
In the above code, `UserVersion` objects are being looked up by a user-specific `user_version_id` rather than the system-wide `version_id`.

### Step 3: Implement Multiple Layers of Authorization
If possible, try not to rely solely on API keys for authorization. Implement mechanisms like OAuth for a more secure access control.

```java
// Example of OAuth implementation in Java
OAuthService service = new ServiceBuilder()
   .provider(SampleApi.class)
   .apiKey("your_api_key")
   .apiSecret("your_api_secret")
   .callback ("http://your_callback_url")
   .scope("permissions_you_want")
   .build();
```
### Step 4: Regular Audit and Software Update
Always ensure that your software versions are updated. Carry out regular audits and penetration tests to identify any security issues. Make use of security tools and resources available in the market to conduct these audits. 

Please note that this issue is contextual and the above steps are just a general guideline. The remediation steps may vary depending on how your API works and the programming language that it has been built with.
