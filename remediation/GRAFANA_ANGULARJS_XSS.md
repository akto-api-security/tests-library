# Remediation for GRAFANA_ANGULARJS_XSS

## Remediation Steps for Grafana Angularjs Rendering Cross-Site Scripting
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities within Grafana AngularJS rendering could potentially allow an attacker to inject unauthorized JavaScript code, therefore making it a serious security issue.

To combat this, we recommend updating Grafana to the latest version, as this issue has been addressed in more recently released versions. If an upgrade is not immediately possible due to constraints, it is advised to disable any vulnerable features or services until an upgrade can be performed.

### Step 1: Update Grafana to the Latest Version
If you're running Grafana on a system using package manager like `yum` or `apt`, use these commands to update:

```bash
# For CentOS/RHEL systems
sudo yum update grafana

# For Ubuntu/Debian systems
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade grafana
```
Or, If you are using docker, pull the latest docker image of Grafana:

```bash
docker pull grafana/grafana:latest
```

### Step 2: Restart Grafana Service Post Update
Once Grafana is updated, it is necessary to restart the Grafana service. The methods for this can vary depending on your exact Grafana setup. However, commonly, these are done via a system's service manager, like `systemctl` or directly through Docker:

```bash
# For CentOS/RHEL/Ubuntu systems
sudo systemctl restart grafana-server

# For Docker
docker restart <container_id>
```

### Step 3: Regular Audit and Update
Perform regular checks for any available Grafana updates to keep your software and environment safe. Any further updates can then be installed following similar procedures.

```bash
# For CentOS/RHEL systems
yum check-update grafana

# For Ubuntu/Debian systems
apt list --upgradable | grep grafana

# For Docker
docker pull grafana/grafana:latest
```

Remember, ALWAYS test updates in a safe environment before applying them to your production systems.
