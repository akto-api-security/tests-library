## Remediation Steps for Denial of Service Test on Date Type Fields in API endpoint using extreme values

A Denial of Service (DoS) attack on Date Type Fields in an API endpoint using extreme values can lead to devastating effects, slowing down or even paralyzing our system. 

### Step 1: Validate Input Fields
The first step in remediation is validating the input date fields. Use built-in date validation functions to ensure that only valid dates are admitted. This could be any of the built-in date functions depending on your programming language of choice. This validation should be done at the API endpoint before processing the date fields.

```javascript
// Example in JavaScript
var isValidDate = function(date) {
    return date instanceof Date && !isNaN(date);
}
```

### Step 2: Limit the Range of Admitted Dates
Limit the range of admitted dates to a reasonable span. For instance, your application might only accept dates between the years 1900 and 2100.

```javascript
// Example in JavaScript
var isInRange = function(date) {
    var minDate = new Date(1900, 0, 1);
    var maxDate = new Date(2100, 11, 31);
    return date >= minDate && date <= maxDate;
}
```

### Step 3: Employ Rate Limiting
A Denial of Service attack typically involves a high number of requests from the same IP address in a short span of time. Consider employing rate limiting on your API endpoint to limit the number of requests an IP address can make within a certain timeframe.

```javascript
// Example using Express.js rate limit middleware
const rateLimit = require("express-rate-limit");
const limiter = rateLimit({
   windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, 
   max: 100 
});
app.use(limiter); 
```

### Step 4: Implement Error Handling
Implement error handling to catch and respond to erroneous inputs. This could include responding with an `HTTP 400 (Bad Request)`  status code for invalid dates.

You should also monitor error logs for your API, to notice patterns indicating possible DoS attacks.

```javascript
// Error handling example in JavaScript
app.use((error, req, res, next) => {
    if (error instanceof SyntaxError) { 
        return res.status(400).send({status: "Input is not a valid date!"});
    } else {
       next();
    }
});
```
