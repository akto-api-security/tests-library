# Remediation for EXPONENTIAL_ENTITY_EXPANSION

## Remediation Steps for Exponential Entity Expansion (XML Bomb) Issue

Exponential Entity Expansion, also known as an XML Bomb or Billion Laughs Attack, is a serious security issue that can be used to exploit XML parsing software. Attackers use nested entities to trigger recursive parsing, leading to denial-of-service (DoS) due to excessive memory consumption.

### Step 1: Disable XML External Entity (XXE) Processing

**Python** (defusedxml library - recommended approach)

```python
from defusedxml.ElementTree import parse

tree = parse(xmlfile)
```

**Java** (example using the DocumentBuilderFactory class)

```java
import javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilderFactory;

DocumentBuilderFactory dbf = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();
dbf.setExpandEntityReferences(false);
```

### Step 2: Limit Entity Expansion

It's also advisable to limit entity expansion to prevent a possible XML Bomb.

**Java** (example using Xerces2 implementation)

```java
System.setProperty("entityExpansionLimit", "100");
```

### Step 3: Use Less Vulnerable Data Interchange Formats

Where possible, employ data interchange formats that are less vulnerable to injection attacks, such as JSON.

### Step 4: Regular Audit and Update

Invest in regular auditing and updating of your XML Parser or libraries to ensure any new vulnerabilities are promptly addressed. Always use a secure version of libraries and ensure they are updated.

**Python**

```bash
pip install --upgrade defusedxml
```

**Java**

Regularly check and update your XML parser (e.g., Xerces2, JAXP) to the newest version.
