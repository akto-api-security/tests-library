# Remediation for UNION_CREDIT_CARD_DATA_PAYLOAD_POSTGRESQLI_GET

## Remediation Steps for Union based SQL Injection with Credit Card Data Extraction Payload

Union-based SQL Injection is a potent security vulnerability and it's even more worrisome when Credit Card data extraction payload is involved. Here are remediation steps for such an issue especially for GET method APIs in a PostegreSQL database.

### Step 1: Validating User Input

The first line of defense against SQL injection is to validate user input. Never trust the user input blindly. 

This can be in Python as follows:

```python
from flask_wtf import FlaskForm
from wtforms import StringField, SubmitField
from wtforms.validators import DataRequired

class UserInputForm(FlaskForm):
    user_input = StringField('User Input', validators=[DataRequired()])
    submit = SubmitField('Submit')
```

### Step 2: Parameterized Queries/Prepared Statements

Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to ensure user input is treated strictly as data and not as part of SQL command. Here's how you can do it in Node.js:

```javascript
const { Pool, Client } = require('pg')
const pool = new Pool()

pool.query("SELECT * FROM USERS WHERE email = $1;", [userInput]
, function(err, result) {
  //... code here
})
```

### Step 3: Stored Procedures

In some cases, it might be worthwhile to use stored procedures in PostgreSQL. Stored procedures make it hard for classic SQL injection to occur because the actual SQL command is defined in the stored procedure itself, and user input is passed as parameters.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_users(email IN text)
  RETURNS TABLE(id INTEGER, name TEXT) AS
$BODY$
BEGIN
  RETURN QUERY SELECT id, name FROM USERS WHERE email = get_users.email;
END;
$BODY$
LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

### Step 4: Least Privilege Principle

In PostgreSQL, ensure the database user used by the application has only the permissions necessary to perform its job and no more. This constrains the success of a potential attacker in manipulating the database by limiting their permissions.

```sql
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON myTable TO myUser;
```

### Step 5: Regular Audit and Update

Ensure you're constantly monitoring the logs for suspicious activity, and keep your PostgreSQL version updated.

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade postgresql
```

These steps, if followed, can significantly mitigate the threat of Union-based SQL Injection attacks with Credit Card Data Extraction Payload on GET method APIs. Always ensure you're following best security practices for your applications.
