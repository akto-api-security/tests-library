# Remediation for SENSITIVE_DATA_EXPOSURE_LICENCE

## Remediation Steps for Sensitive data exposure for LICENCE
Sensitive data exposure is a serious security issue. Sensitive data, such as software license information, can be unintentionally exposed and may lead to unauthorized access and licence violation.

### Step 1: Hide LICENSE file from Public Access
Remove the LICENSE file from the public directory. Use the following command:

```bash
mv LICENCE ~/private_directory/
```
Replace `~/private_directory/` with the path to a secure directory.

### Step 2: Exclude LICENSE File in .gitignore
To prevent the LICENSE file from being unintentionally committed and pushed to a public repository, you should add it to a `.gitignore` file. Append the following line to your `.gitignore` file:

```
LICENCE
```

The result should look something similar to this:

```bash
nano .gitignore

# existing ignored files
# ...
 
# Ignore the LICENSE file
LICENCE
```

### Step 3: Remove LICENSE file from Git History
You also need to ensure that the LICENSE file is removed from your git history. Use the following command:

```bash
git filter-branch --force --index-filter \
'git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch LICENCE' \
--prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all
```

### Step 4: Regular Audit and Update
Ensure that only authorized personnel can access sensitive files. Regularly audit for any exposed sensitive files and update software to fix any known security vulnerabilities.

```bash
# Check for exposed sensitive files
find / -name "LICENCE" 2>/dev/null

# Regularly update software
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
```
Verify that sensitive files are not exposed by navigating to your project and confirming that the LICENCE file is not accessible. 

Remember, regular audits, and software updates are necessary to maintain a secure environment.
