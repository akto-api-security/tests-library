# Remediation for PROMETHEUS_METRICS

## Remediation Steps for Exposed Prometheus Metrics
Exposed Prometheus metrics can leak sensitive information and reveal the internal state of your applications which can be used for malicious intent. Therefore, it is crucial to secure your Prometheus metrics.

### Step 1: Enable Basic Authentication

Prometheus allows to use basic authentication. This can be done simply by providing a username and password on the command line as flags. Prometheus must be restarted after changing the command line. 

```bash
./prometheus --web.config.file=web-config.yml
```

And the `web-config.yml` would look like the following:

```yaml
basic_auth_users:
  westeros_user: jonsnow
```

### Step 2: Use HTTPS for Prometheus 

To ensure data in transit is secure you should enable HTTPS. A `web-config.yml` could look like this:

```yaml
tls_server_config:
  cert_file: /path/to/fullchain.pem
  key_file: /path/to/privkey.pem
```

### Step 3: Set up a Reverse Proxy 

It is also possible to set up a reverse proxy. This can be very useful to add SSL, basic authentication, and other features.

Here is an example using Nginx:

```nginx
location /prometheus {
  proxy_pass http://localhost:9090;
  proxy_http_version 1.1;
  proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
  proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
  proxy_read_timeout 600s;
  proxy_send_timeout 600s;
}
```

After the changes, don't forget to restart the Nginx service.

```bash
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

### Step 4: Regular Audit and Update

Last but important, is to keep your Prometheus system and entire infrastructure updated and regularly audited.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
```

This ensures that any freshly discovered vulnerabilities in these systems don't leave your metrics exposure to potential attackers.
