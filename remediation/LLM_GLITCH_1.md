# Remediation for LLM_GLITCH_1

## Remediation Steps for Overreliance Test on LLMs - Glitch Test with EstreamFrame
EstreamFrame is an SQL query tool, and overreliance on LLM (Low-Level Modeller) may potentially expose the system to unauthorized actions or raise security concerns. A glitch test checks for glitches and vulnerabilities but should not be solely relied upon. Here are the remediation steps:

### Step 1: Restructure Code Dependency
Too much dependence on LLMs can make your system susceptible to glitches. Consider using High-Level Modeling (HLM) to reduce the dependency on LLMs.

```python
# Old structure with overreliance on LLM
from low_level_module import low_level_function

def my_function():
    return low_level_function()

# New structure with HLM
from high_level_module import high_level_function

def my_function():
    return high_level_function()
```

### Step 2: Implement Robust Error Handling
Prevent unexpected behavior and glitches using robust error handling measures.

```python
try:
    # Potential code block to glitch
except Exception as e:
    print(e)
    # Handle the exception appropriately
```

### Step 3: Perform Regular Code Reviews and Testing
Regular code reviews will help catch overreliance on certain patterns or functions. Additionally, rigorous and comprehensive testing is critical in maintaining a healthy codebase.

```bash
# Use automated testing tools
pytest mymodule/test_my_function.py
```

### Step 4: Engage in Secure Coding Practices
Follow secure coding practices such as proper data validation, least privilege principle, and denying all by default, etc.

```javascript
// Example of data validation in JavaScript
if(!validator.isEmail(userInput)) {
    throw new Error('Invalid email address');
}
```
