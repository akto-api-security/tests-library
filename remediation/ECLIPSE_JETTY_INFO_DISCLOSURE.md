# Remediation for ECLIPSE_JETTY_INFO_DISCLOSURE

## Remediation Steps for Eclipse Jetty Information Disclosure

Eclipse Jetty Information Disclosure is a crucial security vulnerability. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to disclose sensitive information, which might assist in launching further attacks. Implementing a security manager can assist in mitigating such an information disclosure issue.

If you came across this security issue, please follow the remediation steps provided below to secure your systems.

Before making any changes, **backup your configuration files**.

### Step 1: Configure a Java Security Manager

A Java Security Manager can be employed to limit the operations that can be performed by a Java process. The Security Manager by default prevents all operations, and permissions must be explicitly granted in the Java policy configuration file.

Add the following parameters to your JVM start up options:

```bash
-Djava.security.manager -Djava.security.policy=[path_to_policy_file]
```

Where `[path_to_policy_file]` is the path to a valid Java policy file on your system.

A minimal security policy file, jetty.policy, might be like so:

```java
grant {
    permission java.security.AllPermission;
};
```

**NOTE:** This grants all permissions to all codes and should be modified based on your requirements.

### Step 2: Update to the Latest Version

Update the Jetty server to its latest version to benefit from the most recent security fixes.

```bash
sudo apt-get install --only-upgrade jetty
```

If an upgrade is not possible due to software dependencies, it is recommended to follow the vendor's specific instructions for mitigation.
