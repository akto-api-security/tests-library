## Remediation Steps for SQL Injection Test on Cookie Header

SQL Injection on Cookie Header is a critical security threat that can allow attackers to manipulate your database queries. It is important to properly validate and sanitize all data that comes from a form of user input, including cookies, to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.

### Step 1: Use Prepared Statements

A primary way to avoid SQL Injection is by using prepared statements. Following is an example of how you can use `prepared statements` in PHP:

```php
// Assuming connection is $conn
$stmt = $conn->prepare("INSERT INTO MyGuests (firstname, lastname, email) VALUES (?, ?, ?)");
$stmt->bind_param("sss", $firstname, $lastname, $email);

// Set variables
$firstname = "John";
$lastname = "Doe";
$email = "john@example.com";
$stmt->execute();
```

The "sss" argument lists the types of parameters that the query expects: 's' for string.

### Step 2: Validate Cookie Data

Always validate the cookie data before using it in any query. This includes checking the type, length, format, and range.

```php
// Assuming $_COOKIE["user"] is user input
$userInput = $_COOKIE["user"];

// Check type
if (!is_string($userInput)) {
    die("Invalid user");
}

// Check length
if (strlen($userInput) > 64) {
    die("Invalid user");
}
```

### Step 3: Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF)

Consider using a WAF, such as ModSecurity, which can potentially block SQL injection attempts. 

```bash
# Install ModSecurity on Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-security2
# Enable ModSecurity
sudo a2enmod security2
```
