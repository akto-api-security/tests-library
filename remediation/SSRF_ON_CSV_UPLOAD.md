# Remediation for SSRF_ON_CSV_UPLOAD

## Remediation Steps for AWS Details Exposed via SSRF
Exposing sensitive AWS details due to Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks is a serious security concern. Attackers may exploit this vulnerability to access sensitive resources and perform unauthorized operations.

### Step 1: Validate CSV File Upload 
You should first implement rigorous checks to validate the CSV file uploaded by users. Here is a small sample code snippet in Python using the `pandas` library:
```python
import pandas as pd

def validate_csv(file):
    try:
        df = pd.read_csv(file)
    except:
        raise ValueError("Invalid CSV file")

    # You can add more checks to validate the content of the CSV file
    # ...
```

### Step 2: Parameterize URL
Instead of directly concatenating user inputs into URLs, use secure functions that provide parameterized inputs. Here is an example in Python using the `urllib` library:
```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin, urlencode

base_url = "http://example.com"
params = {"param1": "value1", "param2": "value2"}  # these values should come from a secure source and not directly from user inputs

# Use urlencode to convert dictionary to query string
query_string = urlencode(params)

# Use urljoin to combine base_url and query_string securely
full_url = urljoin(base_url, '?' + query_string)
```

### Step 3: Restrict AWS IAM Roles
Limit the permissions of the AWS Identity Access Management (IAM) roles associated with the app. To mitigate the impact of an SSRF vulnerability, ensure that the execution role for the AWS Lambda function has least privilege access.

```bash
aws iam put-role-policy --role-name my-role-name --policy-name my-policy-name --policy-document file://my-role-policy.json
```

In `my-role-policy.json`:
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": ["lambda:InvokeFunction"],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Step 4: Regularly Audit and Update Security Policies
Regular security audits and updates are essential to ensure the robustness of your defenses.
