## Remediation Steps for SQL Injection in Payment Gateway API and GET method APIs

SQL Injection is a critical security vulnerability that could allow an attacker to manipulate SQL queries, leading to unauthorized access, data loss, and data breaches. 

### Step 1: Use Parameterized Queries or Prepared Statements
The first step to remediation is always to use parameterized queries or prepared statements. This separates the data being passed in from the query itself, meaning that an attacker canâ€™t interfere with the query structure.

In PHP with MySQLi it would be something like:
```php
$stmt = $mysqli->prepare('SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ?');
$stmt->bind_param('s', $email);
$stmt->execute();
$result = $stmt->get_result();
while ($row = $result->fetch_assoc()) {
    // ... handle $row ...
}
$stmt->close();
```
### Step 2: Implement Proper Error Handling
Never reveal database errors to users - it provides insights to attackers. Instead, log errors and show a generic message to the user. 

```php
try {
  // Execute some code
} catch (Exception $e) {
  // Log the error
  error_log($e->getMessage());
  // Display a generic message
  echo "An error occurred, please try again later.";
}
```
### Step 3: Limit Database Permissions
Minimize the potential impact of an SQL Injection attack by using the principle of least privilege. This means that a database connection should have the minimum levels of access necessary to perform its job. Administrative commands such as DROP TABLE and DELETE should be restricted.

### Step 4: Regularly Update and Patch
Ensure your database management system (DBMS) and application dependencies are always up-to-date with security patches. Many modern DBMS such as MySQL are quite secure if kept up-to-date and properly configured.

### Step 5: Review Your Use of APIs
GET requests can leave sensitive information exposed in server logs. Therefore, avoid sending sensitive information through GET methods. Instead, use secure methods such as HTTPS POST.

```python
import requests
payload = {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}
r = requests.post("https://httpbin.org/post", data=payload)
```
