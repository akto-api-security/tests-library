## Remediation Steps for Denial of Service Test by Long and Random IP Address in Headers

This type of Denial of Service (DoS) attack utilizes excessive resource consumption via long and random IP addresses in headers. It can lead to the disruption of services, causing them unreachable to legitimate users. 

The remediation steps involve validating and limiting the length and formatting of the IP addresses in the headers. This can be achieved using code scripts in programming languages. Here, we will use Python for the implementation.

### Step 1: Install Necessary Python Libraries
```bash
pip install validators
```

### Step 2: Validate the IP Address
The `validators` library can be used to verify if the received IP address is valid or not.

```python
import validators

def validate_ip(input_ip):
    if validators.ipv4(input_ip) or validators.ipv6(input_ip):
        return True
    return False
```
Where `input_ip` is the IP address from the header.

### Step 3: Limit the Length of the IP Address
Since the upper limit of an IPv6 address including colons is 39 characters, an upper limit of 40 characters for headers containing IP addresses should suffice. This can be done using the `len()` function.

```python
def limit_length(input_ip, length_limit=40):
    if len(input_ip) > length_limit:
        return False
    return True
```

### Step 4: Use Combined IP Address Validation and Length Limitation in Headers
The combined function that validates the IP address and checks its length is shown below:

```python
def process_ip_from_header(header_ip):
    isValid = validate_ip(header_ip)
    isLengthOk = limit_length(header_ip)
    if isValid and isLengthOk:
        # Proceed with the IP address in the header
        pass
    else:
        raise ValueError("IP address in the header is either Invalid or Too Long.")
```
Ensure to replace `header_ip` with the actual value from the headers in your application.

Regularly update libraries and review the code to prevent possible exploit of any uncovered vulnerabilities.
