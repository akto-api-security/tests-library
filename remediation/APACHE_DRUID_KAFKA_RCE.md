## Remediation Steps for Apache Druid Kafka Connect Remote Code Execution

The remote code execution vulnerability in Apache Druid allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected deployments. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker may compromise the system that Apache Druid runs on. Here are the remediation steps to help mitigate this issue.

### Step 1: Update your Apache Druid to the Latest Version

The first and foremost step is to update your Apache Druid to the latest version, where the vulnerability is fixed. 

```bash
wget https://downloads.apache.org/druid/druid-0.20.0-bin.tar.gz
tar -zxvf druid-0.20.0-bin.tar.gz 
cd druid-0.20.0
```

### Step 2: Patch the System

If you are unable to upgrade your Apache Druid for some reason, as a temporary measure you can manually patch your system.

Apache Druid can be configured to require a validation for specific Kafka permissions. To do this, add a new property to the consumer and producer properties.

```bash
# Add these lines to the consumer.properties and producer.properties files
security.protocol=SSL
ssl.truststore.location=/var/private/ssl/kafka.client.truststore.jks
```

Here note that this solution is temporary, and should not delay the necessary update.

### Step 3: Validate the Fix

After you have performed the update or patch, ensure that the fix has been applied correctly.

```bash
# Run the druid command
./bin/druid version
```

You should not see any errors resulting from the vulnerability after this step.
