## Remediation Steps for Ruby on Rails Web Console Remote Code Execution
Ruby on Rails Web Console Remote Code Execution is a high-risk vulnerability. Attackers who exploit this vulnerability can execute arbitrary code in the context of the affected system.
### Step 1: Verify Vulnerability
First, identify whether your Rails version is vulnerable.

```bash
grep web-console Gemfile.lock
```

### Step 2: Update Vulnerable Packages
If your `web-console` gem version is less than 3.0.0, it is recommended to upgrade to a version that is not vulnerable.

```bash
gem 'web-console', '>= 3.0.0'
bundle update web-console
```

### Step 3: Restrict the Web Console Access
After that, ensure that the console can only be accessed in the development environment. It's not recommended to allow access in production environments. In your `config/application.rb`, add:

```ruby
# in config/application.rb
config.web_console.development_only = true
```

### Step 4: Whitelist Your Local IP
To further secure your environment, whitelist your local IP and restrict other IPs.

```ruby
# config/environments/development.rb
console.whitelisted_ips = '192.168.0.1'
```

Replace `'192.168.0.1'` with your development machine's IP.
