## Remediation Steps for Bypass Admin Restrictions via URL Encoding
Bypass Admin Restrictions via URL Encoding is a critical security issue where attackers manipulate URLs with encoded characters to bypass security checks. Here, we will highlight a simple method of validating URL encoding at server side â€“ this can be done in many languages, including JavaScript (Node.js).

### Step 1: Install URIjs Library
URIjs is a javascript library for working with URLs. It can be used to decode URLs and ensure it is safe.
Using NPM (Node Package Manager), you can install URIjs like this:

```bash
npm install urijs
```

### Step 2: Validate and Decode URLs
Validate the incoming client URLs and decode them before processing.

```javascript
var URI = require('urijs');

function validateUrl(req, res, next) {
  try {
    var originalUrl = decodeURIComponent(req.originalUrl);
    var decodedUrl = URI.decode(originalUrl);

    if (originalUrl !== decodedUrl) {
      throw new Error('URL encoding mismatch');
    }
    next();
  } catch(err) {
    res.status(400).send({ error: 'Invalid URL encoding' });
  }
}
app.use(validateUrl);
```

### Step 3: Configure Server to Deny Encoded URLs
With the validation function in place, the server will now deny any client requests with mischievous URL encoding.
