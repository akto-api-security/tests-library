## Remediation Steps for Sensitive Data Exposure in NPM ACCESS

Sensitive data exposure in NPM ACCESS can allow attackers to get unauthorized access to sensitive data. It's crucial to secure NPM ACCESS to prevent this.

### Step 1: Use Private Modules
By using private modules, we can limit access to only the users that are allowed. To do this, we can use the npm access command as follows:

```bash
npm access restricted my_package
```

Where my_package is the name of your package.

### Step 2: Use Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

NPM provides an option to add an extra layer of security by implementing two-factor authentication (2FA). It prevents unauthorized users from modifying the package. The command to enable this is:

```bash
npm profile enable-2fa
```

### Step 3: Set Token Rules

Setting NPM_TOKEN in the .npmrc file can help in preventing unauthorized access. Be sure your .npmrc doesn't have a wildcard for the hostname, as this may put the token at risk:

```bash
//registry.npmjs.org/:_authToken=NPM_TOKEN
```

> Note: Please replace `NPM_TOKEN` with your actual token.

After these steps, the risk of sensitive data exposure in NPM ACCESS should be significantly reduced. Regular audit and update of the package is also recommended.

```bash
npm audit
```

```bash
npm update
```
