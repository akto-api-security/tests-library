# Remediation for UNION_CASE_CHANGE_BASED_MYSQL_SQLI_POST

## Remediation Steps for Union-Based SQL Injection

Union Based SQL Injection is a type of SQL Injection attack that uses the UNION SQL operator to combine the results of the original query with results from injected malicious SQL queries. The attacker can manipulate the results and execute arbitrary SQL queries in the database.

### Step 1: Input Validation
Proper input validation can help prevent SQL injection attacks. Use programming functions such as `is_numeric()` or `is_string()` for validation.

```php
if(!is_numeric($data)){
    // exit or throw error
}
```

### Step 2: Use Prepared Statements
Use prepared statements with parameterized queries. They ensure that the parameters (i.e., the user input) passed into SQL queries are treated safely, thus preventing SQL injection.

For example, using PHP with MySQL, you can use prepared statements like this:

```php
$stmt = $dbConnection->prepare('SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name = ?');
$stmt->bind_param('s', $name);

$name = $_POST['username'];
$stmt->execute();
```

### Step 3: Use a Web Application Firewall
A Web Application Firewall (WAF) can help block SQL injection attacks by inspecting the HTTP/HTTPS traffic and identifying and blocking malicious requests.

### Step 4: Limit Database Permissions
Ensure that database accounts used by web applications have the least privileges necessary.
