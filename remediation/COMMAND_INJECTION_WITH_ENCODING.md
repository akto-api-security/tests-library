## Remediation Steps for Command Injection through Encoding and Character Manipulation

Command injection through encoding and character manipulation is a severe security vulnerability, allowing malicious actors to execute arbitrary commands on a system.

### Step 1: Input Validation
The first line of defense against command injection is proper input validation. Inputs should be validated using a whitelist approach to only accept expected and safe input. Deny all other input that does not strictly meet these requirements.

For instance, in JavaScript, you could use a regular expression to validate input:

```javascript
let input = userInput;
if (!/^[a-zA-Z0-9]*$/.test(input)) {
    throw new Error('Invalid input');
}
```

### Step 2: Use Secure APIs/Functions
Avoid using functions that can execute commands. Instead, use APIs that perform the required functionality without command execution capability. 

For example, in Python, use: 

```python
import os
path = os.path.join(userInput)
```

Instead of:
```python
os.system('ls ' + userInput)
```

### Step 3: Use Parameterized APIs
Some APIs provide parameterized versions, offering automatic escaping and quoting of arguments, thus preventing command injection.

For instance, in Java using Prepared Statements: 

```java
String userInput = "...";
PreparedStatement stmt = connection.prepareStatement("INSERT INTO users VALUES (?)");
stmt.setString(1, userInput); // automatically escapes and quotes userInput
stmt.executeUpdate();
```

### Step 4: Escaping Special Characters
If command execution needs to be used, ensure all untrusted data used in the command line are properly escaped. This prevents command injection by ensuring user input is not treated as part of the command itself.

For instance, PHP provides the function `escapeshellarg()` to escape user input:

```php
$command = 'ls ' . escapeshellarg($userInput);
system($command);
```

### Step 5: Use of Least Privilege Principle
Ensure that the code runs with the fewest privileges possible, reducing the potential damage if a command injection occurs.
