## Remediation Steps for Bypassing Captcha-Based Protection by Adding Headers

Bypassing captcha protection by adding headers is a critical security issue. Attackers who exploit this vulnerability can misuse these systems by posing as a large number of users. 

### Step 1: Validate HTTP Headers

The easiest way to start is by validating HTTP headers on the server side. Never trust user inputs blindly.

```python
from flask import request

@app.route('/', methods=['POST'])
def login():
    captcha_response = request.headers.get('X-Captcha')
    if not captcha_response:
        return "Captcha Response Not Found.", 400
    # This is a simple example. Real-world header validation would be much more complex.
```

### Step 2: Implement Server-side Captcha Verification

Next, to strengthen the protection of your application, you should validate the captcha response by making a server-side request to the captcha provider's API.

```python
import requests

def verify_captcha(response):
    URL = "https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api/siteverify"
    SECRET_KEY = "your secret key"
    payload = {
        'secret': SECRET_KEY,
        'response': response
    }
    response = requests.post(URL, payload)
    return response.json()['success']
```
