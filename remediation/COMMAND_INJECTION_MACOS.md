# Remediation for COMMAND_INJECTION_MACOS

## Remediation Steps for Command Injection in MacOS Identification 

Command injection is a serious security issue which allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on a host operating system using a vulnerable application. In MacOS environment, system specific operations are even more critical due to its unique command system and, as such, should be thoroughly safeguarded to prevent command injections.

### Step 1: Parameterize your commands
Where possible, prefer to use parameterized APIs or libraries for your language of choice. Almost all languages have their own libraries to prevent execution of arbitrary user code.

In Python,
```python
import subprocess
subprocess.run(['ls', '-l'], check=True)
```

In JavaScript (Node.js),
```javascript
const { spawn } = require('child_process');
const ls = spawn('ls', ['-l']);
```
### Step 2: Limit permissions
You should always run processes with the fewest privileges possible.

In Bash,
```bash
chmod 700 /my/script.sh
```
### Step 3: Avoid passing user input as commands
By allowing user input to be part of a shell command, you open the system to possible command injection. 

Source code should never be directly reflective of raw user inputs. If user interactions need to influence system operations, consider permitted lists, where operations are pre-determined and any user input is matched against the list, not the system operation.

Example with Python,
```python
operations = ['start', 'stop', 'restart']
user_operation = get_user_operation()  # hypotethical function to get user input
if user_operation not in operations:
    raise ValueError("Invalid operation!")
else:
    subprocess.run(['systemctl', user_operation, 'my-service'], check=True)
```
Again, the languages you'll use might differ, as might the improvements you'll find. But keystone best practices like these are critical in maintaining robustness against vulnerabilities like command injection. Regular audits and code revisions for ever-growing needs and insights is also suggested best practice.
