# Remediation for SENSITIVE_DATA_EXPOSURE_REDIS_URI_SECRET

## Remediation Steps for Sensitive Data Exposure for REDIS URI SECRET

Sensitive data exposure, like exposing a REDIS URI secret, can be a grave security issue. Sensitive data should always be protected and its exposure could lead to unauthorized access to critical data.

### Step 1: Remove sensitive data from source code
Sensitive data such as REDIS URI secret should not be present in your source code. Remove any hardcoded secrets. If you are using Git, make sure you purge these secrets from your git history as well.

```bash
git filter-branch --force --index-filter \
  'git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch path_to_file' \
  --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all
```

### Step 2: Use Environment Variables for sensitive data
You should provide REDIS URI secret as environment variables. Environment variables are a secure way to pass configurations to your application.

Example for Node.js application:

```javascript
const redis = require('redis');

const client = redis.createClient({
  url: process.env.REDIS_URL
});
```

Make sure to set environment variable securely in your server:

```bash
export REDIS_URL=redis://user:secret@localhost:6379
```

### Step 3: Encrypt Sensitive Data
If there is a need to store the secret in your application, remember to encrypt the data using reliable encryption services like AWS KMS, Hashicorp Vault, etc.

Using Hashicorp Vault's transit secrets engine:

```bash
vault write transit/encrypt/my-key plaintext=$(base64 <<< "my plaintext string")
```
