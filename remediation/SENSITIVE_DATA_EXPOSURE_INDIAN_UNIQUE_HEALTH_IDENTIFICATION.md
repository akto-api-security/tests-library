# Remediation for SENSITIVE_DATA_EXPOSURE_INDIAN_UNIQUE_HEALTH_IDENTIFICATION

## Remediation Steps for Sensitive Data Exposure of Unique Health Identification in India

Sensitive data exposure is a critical security issue that can lead to severe data breaches. To prevent unauthorized access to the Unique Health Identification data, it's very important to take specific actions as follows.

### Step 1: Use Secure Protocols for Data Transfer

Always transfer identified data over the network using secure protocols like HTTPS, FTPS, or SFTP. Never send sensitive data over non-secure protocols.

### Step 2: Implement Encryption

Implement effective encryption measures to secure sensitive data. Here's a Python code snippet that can be used to encrypt and decrypt data using the Fernet symmetric encryption method.

```python
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet

def generate_key():
    """
    Generates a key and save it into a file
    """
    key = Fernet.generate_key()
    with open("secret.key", "wb") as key_file:
        key_file.write(key)

def load_key():
    """
    Load the previously generated key
    """
    return open("secret.key", "rb").read()

def encrypt_message(message):
    """
    Encrypts a message
    """
    key = load_key()
    encoded_message = message.encode()
    f = Fernet(key)
    encrypted_message = f.encrypt(encoded_message)

    return encrypted_message

def decrypt_message(encrypted_message):
    """
    Decrypts an encrypted message
    """
    key = load_key()
    f = Fernet(key)
    decrypted_message = f.decrypt(encrypted_message)

    return decrypted_message.decode()
```

### Step 3: Secure Data at Rest

Use strong access controls, hashing, salting, or other effective methods to secure data at rest.
