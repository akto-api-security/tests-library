# Remediation for RUBY_RAILS_RCE

## Remediation Steps for Ruby on Rails Remote Code Execution

Ruby on Rails Remote Code Execution is a serious security issue that can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server. The vulnerability often occurs when user inputs are not properly sanitized and are used in command line operations in the application.

### Step 1: Update Ruby on Rails Version
First and foremost, you should update your Ruby on Rails to the latest version. Many older versions have known vulnerabilities including the ability for remote code execution.

```bash
gem update rails
```

### Step 2: Sanitize User Inputs
User inputs should always be treated as untrusted data. Therefore, it's important to sanitize and escape user inputs before using them in your application. This can be done by writing a sanitization method or using existing Ruby on Rails sanitization helpers.

```ruby
def sanitize(user_input)
  CGI::escapeHTML(user_input)
end
```

### Step 3: Avoid Interpolation of User Input
Avoid interpolating user input in command line operations. By interpolating user input directly, you're inviting the possibility of command injection attacks.

```ruby
# Bad
system("echo #{params[:user_input]}")

# Good
system("echo", params[:user_input])
```

### Step 4: Regular Code Reviews and Updates
Conduct regular code reviews and audits to detect any potential security flaws. If a vulnerability is found, patch the code as soon as possible.

```bash
gem outdated
```

Please note that these remediation steps mitigate but do not completely eliminate the threat of Ruby on Rails Remote Code Execution, and it is essential to follow proper security procedures at all times when writing and deploying code. Always stay updated with the latest in security best practices and keep the software updated.
