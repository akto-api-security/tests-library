# Remediation for SENSITIVE_DATA_EXPOSURE_EIN

## Remediation Steps for Sensitive Data - EIN Exposure

Exposing sensitive information like an Employer Identification Number (EIN) can lead to serious security issues like identity theft. Therefore, it's crucial to properly secure any sensitive data before transmitting it.

### Step 1: Encrypt Sensitive Data

Make sure to use strong encryption algorithms like AES to encrypt the data before saving or transmitting.

```python
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
import base64
import os

def encryption(message):
    secret_key = os.urandom(32)
    cipher = AES.new(secret_key,AES.MODE_ECB)
    encoded = base64.b64encode(cipher.encrypt(message.rjust(32)))
    return encoded

# Encrypting EIN
ein = "123456789"
encrypted_ein = encryption(ein)
```

### Step 2: Implement Secure Communication Channels

You should always send sensitive information over a secure HTTPS or other secure communication channels.

```python
import requests

url = "https://secureapi.example.com"
data = {"ein": encrypted_ein}
response = requests.post(url, data)
```

### Step 3: Store Sensitive Data Securely

Never store sensitive data in plain text. Instead, store it in secure databases and always encrypt the data.

```python
import sqlite3

connection = sqlite3.connect('secure_db.db')
cursor = connection.cursor()

# Creates a table with encrypted EIN
cursor.execute("CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS company_info (encrypted_ein TEXT)")

cursor.execute("INSERT INTO company_info VALUES (?)", (encrypted_ein,))
connection.commit()
```

### Step 4: Regular Security Audits 

Performing regular security audits and updating the security measures in place is necessary for protecting the sensitive data. 

```python
# A mock function representing a security audit
def security_audit():
    # Check for exposed sensitive data
    # Check for weak encryption
    # Check for insecure communication channels
    # Check for vulnerabilities in the database
    pass
```

### Step 5: Education and Awareness

Make sure that all individuals and teams in the organization who handle sensitive data are aware of its importance and the necessary security measures.

Note: All keys and sensitive information used in this example are for illustration purposes and should be rotated and controlled in a secure manner in a live system. The secret key should ideally not appear in the source code itself and should be stored securely.
