# Remediation for NOSQLI_BOOLEAN_BASED_REPLACE_BODY

## Remediation Steps for Boolean Based NoSQL Injection

NoSQL injections are a type of web security vulnerability in which an attacker can manipulate NoSQL commands to execute malicious exploits. To protect against Boolean Based NoSQL Injection attacks, consider the following steps:

### Step 1: Use Parameterized Queries or Prepared Statements
In this step, we replace all variable parts of the query with parameters using a method that prevents the parameters from being treated as code.

In Java, you can use PreparedStatements:

```java
String user = "username";
String pass = "password";
PreparedStatement stmt = connection.prepareStatement("SELECT * FROM users WHERE user = ? and password = ?");
stmt.setString(1, user);
stmt.setString(2, pass);

ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery();
```

### Step 2: Use Proper Data Type Checks

Ensure to validate and sanitize the user inputs with appropriate data types.

In Javascript, you can use the `typeof` method:

```javascript
if (typeof(user_input) !== 'string') {
    throw new Error('Invalid Input')
}
```

### Step 3: Use a Database Query API

Avoid submitting raw data directly to the database. Use a database query API that prevents NoSQL injection. Most NoSQL databases will provide such an API.

In MongoDB, you can use the `$ne` (not equal) operator:

```javascript
db.collection.find( { qty: { $ne: 20 } } )
```

### Step 4: Use Database-Agnostic Code

If possible, create your application code independent of your database software, such that it doesn't matter if you're using NoSQL or SQL, the queries sent to the database will always be secure.

### Step 5: Regular Audit and Update

Finally, regularly updating and patching your systems is an effective measure to prevent most types of security vulnerabilities. 

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
```

Avoiding NoSQL injections requires careful coding practices, updates and audits, combined with strong access control methods.
