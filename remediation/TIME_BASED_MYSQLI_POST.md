# Remediation for TIME_BASED_MYSQLI_POST

## Remediation Steps for Time Based SQL Injection in MySQL for POST method APIs

Time based SQL injection attacks exploit a vulnerability in which the database doesnâ€™t properly validate input before using it in SQL queries. This can allow attackers to potentially manipulate and execute arbitrary SQL queries, which can lead to unintended and serious consequences such as unauthorized access or data loss.

### Step 1: Input Data Validation
The first step to remediate time-based SQL injection attacks is to add appropriate input data validation and sanitization. Never trust your inputs and treat all as potentially harmful.
```java
import org.springframework.util.Assert;

public void validateInput(String input) {
  Assert.notNull(input, "Input must not be null");
  Assert.hasLength(input, "Input must not be empty");
  // Add more verification logic if needed
}
```
### Step 2: Use Parameterized Queries or Prepared Statements
Avoiding the construction of SQL queries through string concatenation and instead using parameterized queries or prepared statements can significantly reduce the risk of SQL injection attacks. Here's a sample in Java:

```java
// JDBC example
Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(dbUrl, dbUser, dbPassword);
String sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?";
PreparedStatement preparedStatement = connection.prepareStatement(sql);
preparedStatement.setString(1, username);
ResultSet resultSet = preparedStatement.executeQuery();
```
This ensures that user-provided inputs are not treated as SQL code.

### Step 3: Limit Database Permissions
Limit the permissions given to the database accounts on which your application runs. Don't use the root account or any account with more privileges than necessary. 


### Step 4: Implement Web Application Firewall
Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to filter out malicious data and to help protect against SQL Injection.
