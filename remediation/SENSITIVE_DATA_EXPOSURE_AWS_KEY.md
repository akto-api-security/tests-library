## Remediation Steps for Sensitive Data Exposure in LLMs - AWS Keys

Sensitive data exposure through LLMs (Lambda Layer Managing systems) with exposed AWS Keys can lead to a serious security breach. This issue pertains to the exposure of sensitive data, specifically AWS keys, that must be kept hidden and secure to prevent unauthorized access to your AWS resources.

### Step 1: Remove Hard-Coded AWS Keys

Do not store sensitive data such as AWS keys in your code. This is the starting place of security breaches.

```python
# Bad Practice
aws_access_key_id = "AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE"
aws_secret_access_key = "wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY"
```

### Step 2: Use Environment Variables for Storing AWS Keys

Store your AWS keys as environment variables and reference them in your application through these variables. This ensures that even if someone gets access to your code, they would not get hold of your keys directly.

```python
# Good Practice
import os

aws_access_key_id = os.getenv('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID')
aws_secret_access_key = os.getenv('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY')
```

### Step 3: Use AWS IAM Roles

Best practice is to assign IAM roles to EC2 instances or ECS tasks needing access to other AWS resources. This eliminates the need to use access key and secret access key completely.

### Step 4: Enable AWS Key Rotation

Regularly rotate (change) your AWS Access Keys through the IAM console. Regular key rotation reduces the risk of compromise of keys.
