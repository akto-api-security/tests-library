## Remediation Steps for F5 Admin Interface Exposure

F5 Admin Interface exposure is a major security concern as it allows hackers to potentially infiltrate and manipulate your configuration settings. To avoid unauthorized access, you must protect the interface appropriately.

### Step 1: Modify Administrative Access Settings
Before starting, make sure that the current user has administrator privileges.

You can use the **mod** command to edit access settings, which can be one of the following: **Root**, **Admin**, **Resource Administrator**, **Manager**, **Auditor**, or **Operator**.

Assuming you are scripting this in Python, you can use the `requests` library as shown below:

```python
import requests

headers = {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
}

data = '{"userName":"newUser", "password":"newPassword", "role":"Admin", "shell":"bash"}'

response = requests.put('https://<Your_f5_Big-IP>/mgmt/tm/auth/user/admin', headers=headers, data=data, auth=('admin', 'adminPassword'))
```

### Step 2: Restricting Access by IP Address
To enhance security, you can restrict access to the GUI based on source IP addresses. This ensures that only machines from trusted IP addresses can connect to the F5 admin console.

```python
data = '{"name":"admin_access", "source":"192.0.2.0/24", "destination":"any"}'

response = requests.post('https://<Your_f5_Big-IP>/mgmt/tm/net/firewall/rule', headers=headers, data=data, auth=('admin', 'adminPassword'))
```
