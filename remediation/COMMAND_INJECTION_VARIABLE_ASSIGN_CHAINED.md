## Remediation Steps for Command Injection by Variable Assignment with Chained System Commands
Command Injection by variable assignment with chained system commands is a serious security issue as it may allow attackers to execute arbitrary commands. One way to prevent this is to use a secure coding approach that avoids direct execution of system commands whenever possible.

### Step 1: Avoid Direct System Commands
Instead of directly executing system commands, use API or library functions to perform the task. Use built-in security features that come with your programming language, framework, or library. This might look as follows:

```python
import subprocess

def secure_function(command):
    subprocess.run(command, shell=False, check=True)
```
### Step 2: Use Prepared Statements
If direct system commands are unavoidable due to business requirements, use prepared statements or parameterized queries to ensure user inputs are properly sanitized before execution. 

```java
String user = request.getParameter("user");
String pass = request.getParameter("pass");
 
String SQL = "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE user = ? and pass = ?";
PreparedStatement pstmt = connection.prepareStatement(SQL);
pstmt.setString(1, user);
pstmt.setString(2, pass);
ResultSet rs = pstmt.executeQuery();
```
### Step 3: Implement Proper Input Validation and Sanitization
Validate and sanitize inputs to prevent injection attacks. A basic implementation could look like this:

```javascript
const sanitizeInput = (input) => {
  const escapeChars = {'\$': '\\$', '\;': '\\;', '\&': '\\&', '\|': '\\|'};
  return input.replace(/[\$;&|]/g, m => escapeChars[m]);
}

let userInput = ";rm -rf /";
userInput = sanitizeInput(userInput);
```
### Step 4: Leverage Security Headers and Settings
Ensure that your application adheres to good security hygiene by implementing security-related HTTP headers and settings, such as enforcing strict content security policy.

No code snippet is provided for this step as the implementation details would heavily depend on your application's development environment and framework.
