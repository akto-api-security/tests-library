# Remediation for DOS_ATTACH_LARGE_FILE

## Remediation Steps for Denial of Service by Large Input Files
Denial of Service (DoS) by providing a large file as input is a significant security issue. Application must have proper checks in place to deal with such situations.

### Step 1: Input Validation
In general, always validate input on server side even if it has already been validated on client side.

```java
public void validateFile(MultipartFile file) throws BadRequestException {
    if(file.getSize() > MAX_FILE_SIZE && !file.isEmpty()) {
        throw new BadRequestException("File size should not be greater than " + MAX_FILE_SIZE);
    }
}
```

### Step 2: Handle DoS Attacks

In addition to checking file size, you must implement rate-limiting, which will prevent a user from sending requests too often. You can use libraries like Google's Guava to achieve this.

```java
@Inject
RateLimiter rateLimiter;

public void validateRate() throws ApiException {
    if (!rateLimiter.tryAcquire()) {
        throw new ApiException("Rate limit exceeded. Try again later.");
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Implementing Resource Allocation

Implementing resource allocation is equally important to enforce limits on system resources and minimize the impact of an attack.

```java
@Configuration
public class ThreadPoolConfig {

    @Value("${max.thread.count}")
    private int MAX_THREAD_COUNT;

    @Bean
    public Executor taskExecutor() {
        ThreadPoolTaskExecutor executor = new ThreadPoolTaskExecutor();
        executor.setMaxPoolSize(MAX_THREAD_COUNT);
        executor.initialize();
        return executor;
    }
}
```

### Step 4: Regular Audit and Update
Keep your system updated with patches against all known vulnerabilities of the services being used in your application. This could be regarding the file upload feature or other features of your application.

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
```
This can help you prevent unforeseen security issues by using safe, up-to-date versions of your dependencies and services.
