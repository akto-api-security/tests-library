## Remediation Steps for Denial of Service by Large Input Files
Denial of Service (DoS) by providing a large file as input is a significant security issue. Application must have proper checks in place to deal with such situations.

### Step 1: Input Validation
In general, always validate input on server side even if it has already been validated on client side.

```java
public void validateFile(MultipartFile file) throws BadRequestException {
    if(file.getSize() > MAX_FILE_SIZE && !file.isEmpty()) {
        throw new BadRequestException("File size should not be greater than " + MAX_FILE_SIZE);
    }
}
```

### Step 2: Handle DoS Attacks

In addition to checking file size, you must implement rate-limiting, which will prevent a user from sending requests too often. You can use libraries like Google's Guava to achieve this.

```java
@Inject
RateLimiter rateLimiter;

public void validateRate() throws ApiException {
    if (!rateLimiter.tryAcquire()) {
        throw new ApiException("Rate limit exceeded. Try again later.");
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Implementing Resource Allocation

Implementing resource allocation is equally important to enforce limits on system resources and minimize the impact of an attack.

```java
@Configuration
public class ThreadPoolConfig {

    @Value("${max.thread.count}")
    private int MAX_THREAD_COUNT;

    @Bean
    public Executor taskExecutor() {
        ThreadPoolTaskExecutor executor = new ThreadPoolTaskExecutor();
        executor.setMaxPoolSize(MAX_THREAD_COUNT);
        executor.initialize();
        return executor;
    }
}
```
