# Remediation for MANIPULATE_ACCOUNT_TYPE

## Remediation Steps for Manipulating Account Type

Manipulating account type is a dangerous security flaw. Without proper account type definition and validation, attackers could potentially gain unauthorized access and elevated privileges beyond their intended user roles.

### Step 1: Validate Account Creation Input
```python
# Python pseudocode
def create_account(username, password, account_type):
    # Validate account_type
    valid_account_types = ['user', 'admin', 'guest']
    if account_type not in valid_account_types:
        return 'Invalid account type'
    
    # Continue with account creation...
```
### Step 2: Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Implement RBAC to restrict system access those with enough privileges.

```java
// Java pseudocode
public class Account { 

    private String role;  //user role
    // ... other fields, constructor, getters and setters

    public boolean hasRole(String neededRole) {
      return role.equals(neededRole);
    }
}
```

In this way you can restrict access to methods by checking the user role e.g.

```java
// Function that only admin can access
public void adminFunction(Account account) {
    if(!account.hasRole("admin")) {
        throw new SecurityException("Only admin can access this function");
    }

    // continue with function
} 
```
### Step 3: Regular Audits and Updates
Regularly audit and update security measures to ensure they are not outdated and can effectively guard against account type manipulation.

```bash
# perform system updates
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```

### Step 4: Implement Usage of Prepared Statements
Preventing SQL Injection

```java
// Java pseudocode
String query = "SELECT account_balance FROM user_data WHERE user_name = ? ";
PreparedStatement pstmt = connection.prepareStatement(query);
pstmt.setString(1, userName);
ResultSet results = pstmt.executeQuery();
```

This way you avoid possible SQL injection attacks by directly passing parameters to your SQL query.
