# Remediation for PROMPT_INJECTION_STAN

## Remediation Steps for Prompt Injection with STAN Test on LLMs

Prompt Injections can potentially allow unauthorized code execution during STAN tests on LLMs.

### Step 1: Parameterize SQL Queries

All SQL queries should be parameterized to prevent SQL injection attacks. 

```python
from sqlalchemy import text
with engine.connect() as conn:
    query = text("SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = :name")
    result = conn.execute(query, name="John")
```

### Step 2: Sanitize User Inputs

All user inputs should be properly sanitized before being processed.

```python
import html
def sanitize_input(input_string):
    return html.escape(input_string)
```

### Step 3: Encode Data

When handling binary data, always properly encode the data to a safe format, such as Base64.

```python
import base64
data = b"\x00\x01\x02"
# Encode as Base64
encoded_data = base64.b64encode(data)
```

### Step 4: Proper Exception Handling

Ensure your code handles exceptions properly and does not reveal sensitive information when errors occur.

```python
try:
    risky_operation()
except Exception as e:
    log_error("An error occurred", e)
    raise InternalServerError("An error occurred, please try again later")
```
