# Remediation for PROMPT_INJECTION_STAN

## Remediation Steps for Prompt Injection with STAN Test on LLMs

Prompt Injections can potentially allow unauthorized code execution during STAN tests on LLMs.

### Step 1: Parameterize SQL Queries

All SQL queries should be parameterized to prevent SQL injection attacks. 

```python
from sqlalchemy import text
with engine.connect() as conn:
    query = text("SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = :name")
    result = conn.execute(query, name="John")
```

### Step 2: Sanitize User Inputs

All user inputs should be properly sanitized before being processed.

```python
import html
def sanitize_input(input_string):
    return html.escape(input_string)
```

### Step 3: Encode Data

When handling binary data, always properly encode the data to a safe format, such as Base64.

```python
import base64
data = b"\x00\x01\x02"
# Encode as Base64
encoded_data = base64.b64encode(data)
```

### Step 4: Proper Exception Handling

Ensure your code handles exceptions properly and does not reveal sensitive information when errors occur.

```python
try:
    risky_operation()
except Exception as e:
    log_error("An error occurred", e)
    raise InternalServerError("An error occurred, please try again later")
```
### Step 5: Regular Code Review

A regular review of codebase is highly recommended, specifically focusing on areas where prompt injections are possible. Use of automated testing and vulnerability scanning tools can help in this.

There's no specific source code to prevent prompt injections in STAN tests as it largely depends on the design and implementation of the software. However, these general guidelines should help in securing the application.
