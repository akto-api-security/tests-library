# Remediation for REMOVE_XSRF

## Remediation Steps for Broken Authentication by Removing XSRF Token

Broken authentication via XSRF token removal can lead to application-level vulnerabilities, where an attacker can impersonate a trusted user and perform unwanted or malicious actions. As such, it's important to ensure that your applications are secure from these kind of threats.

Here are the steps to mitigate this risk:

### Step 1: Enable XSRF Protection in your Application
In most modern web frameworks, XSRF protection is built-in and just needs to be enabled. For instance, in Express.js, you need to import `csurf` module and use it as middleware.
```js
var express = require('express');
var cookieParser = require('cookie-parser');
var csrf = require('csurf');
 
var app = express();
app.use(cookieParser());
app.use(csrf({ cookie: true }));

app.get('/form', function(req, res) {
  // pass the csrfToken to your view
  res.render('send', { csrfToken: req.csrfToken() });
});

app.listen(3000);
```
### Step 2: Include XSRF Token in Forms and AJAX Requests
All form submissions and AJAX requests made to server-side methods that mutate data should include the XSRF token. The server should reject any request that lacks a valid XSRF token. In a form, it might look like this:
```html
<form action="/process" method="POST">
  <input type="hidden" name="_csrf" value="<%= csrfToken %>">
  <!-- rest of your form contents -->
</form>
```
### Step 3: Verify the XSRF Token on the Server
On the server side, you need to check that each request contains a valid XSRF token and reject the request if the token is missing or incorrect.
```js
app.post('/process', function (req, res) {
  // your form processing code here
});
```
In the code above, the `csurf` middleware is validates the "_csrf" parameter in the request body against the token it issued to the client. If the value is missing, or it doesn't match the expected value, an error is thrown.

### Step 4: Regular Audit and Update
Always ensure to update to the latest security patches of your framework or modules that you are consuming in your application and practice regular code audits focusing on authorization and authentication parts of your application.
