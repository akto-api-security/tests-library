## Remediation Steps for Denial of Service Test on GraphQL API having Variables Key Sub Parameters with Special Characters

A Denial of Service (DoS) attack can impact the availability of the system, making it unresponsive. If your GraphQL API allows variable keys sub parameters with special characters, it may become vulnerable. Here is how to remediate this security issue.

### Step 1: Data Validation (Input sanitation)
The first and most crucial step to mitigate this vulnerability is to implement strict data validation rules for the API. Specifically, the API should reject variable keys sub parameters that contain special characters. Below is an example of an input sanitation function written in JavaScript.

```javascript
function sanitizeInput(input) {
    // Use regex to remove special characters from the input
    let sanitizedInput = input.replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9 ]/g, '');
    return sanitizedInput;
}
```
This function will remove any non-alphanumeric character from the input, meaning special characters will be stripped out.

### Step 2: Implement Rate Limiting
Rate limiting is another important mitigation. It can protect the API from being overwhelmed by too many requests at once, which could cause a DoS condition. Below is an example of setting up basic rate limiting using Express middleware in Node.js.

```javascript
const rateLimit = require("express-rate-limit");

const limiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 100 // limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
});

//  apply to all requests
app.use(limiter);
```

Setting an appropriate limit based on your API's use case can greatly reduce the risk of DoS attacks.

### Step 3: Regularly Update GraphQL Library

Ensuring your GraphQL library is regularly updated can protect against known vulnerabilities in the library itself, some of which may enable DoS attacks. Make sure to include this in your update and maintenance routines. 

### Step 4: Implement Appropriate Error Handling

Without proper error handling, an illegal input to the API can crash the server, leading to denial of service. Here is how you can handle errors effectively in an Express (Node.js) app:

```javascript
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  console.error(err.stack);
  res.status(500).send('Something broke!');
});
```

This middleware function needs to be added at the end of your middleware stack. It will catch any errors that were not caught and handled earlier in the stack, and prevent crashes due to unhandled exceptions.
