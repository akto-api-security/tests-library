# Remediation for LLM_INSECURE_OUTPUT_3

## Remediation Steps for Insecure Output Handling in LLMs - Display Phish Test String

Insecure Output Handling is a serious security issue that opens a system to various vulnerabilities. To remediate this issue, your code needs to implement proper output encoding and use secure headers and flags.

### Step 1: Implement Proper Output Encoding

Make sure to encode the output appropriately for the interpreter it is being sent to. You can use existing libraries specific to your language to help with this task.

For example, if you're using PHP:

```php
<?php
echo htmlentities($user_input, ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8');
?>
```

### Step 2: Utilize Secure Headers and Flags

Set HTTP response headers to use secure flags. Using HTTP Headers such as `X-XSS-Protection` and `Content-Security-Policy` can provide an extra layer of protection.

For example, for Express.js (Node.js), you can use the `helmet` middleware:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const helmet = require('helmet');

const app = express();

app.use(helmet());
```
