# Remediation for BASIC_XSS

## Remediation Steps for XSS By Changing Request Parameters

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) by changing request parameters is a very common web application vulnerability. It occurs when a web application does not properly validate input before returning it to the end user. 

### Step 1: Input Validation
The initial step in mitigating any XSS attack is to correctly validate any and all inputs. If you're using Java, you can use the OWASP Java Encoder library.

```java
import org.owasp.encoder.Encode;

public String sanitize(String input) {
    return Encode.forHtmlContent(input);
}
```
Perhaps you're using Python, you can use Bleach library for input sanitization.

```python
import bleach

def sanitize(input):
    return bleach.clean(input)
```

### Step 2: Implementing Output Encoding

Additional to input sanitization, output encoding should also be performed. This process involves converting untrusted data into a safe form where the content is represented without executing as code in the browser.

In .NET, Microsoft provides AntiXSS library to perform output encoding.

```csharp
string safeOutput = Microsoft.Security.Application.Encoder.HtmlEncode(untrustedData, false);
```

### Step 3: HttpOnly Cookie 

This tag when applied to the cookie, makes it difficult for an attacker to execute malicious scripts as the cookie can only be accessed from the HTTP/HTTPS connections.

```python
from flask import make_response

resp = make_response(render_template('...'))
resp.set_cookie('username', 'secure', httponly=True)
```

### Step 4: Using Content Security Policy (CSP)

The Content Security Policy (CSP) is an HTTP header that allows website administrators to limit and control the resources a user agent can load for a given webpage.

```python
from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.after_request
def apply_caching(response):
    response.headers["Content-Security-Policy"] = "default-src 'self'"
    return response
```

### Step 5: Regular Audit and Update

Similar to other aspects of security, it's necessary to keep your software up to date, conduct regular code reviews, and perform penetration testing. 

By following these steps, you can greatly reduce the risk of XSS attacks in your applications.
