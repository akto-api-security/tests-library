## Remediation Steps for Buffer Overflow via Large Cookie

Buffer overflow via a large cookie can cause serious security issues, potentially exposing your system to hackers or crashing your service due to the excessive data. Below are the remediation steps to resolve this vulnerability.

### Step 1: Input Validation

The first step is to ensure that all input is properly validated, where possible. In many languages, this can be done with a simple if-statement.

```python
def process_cookie(cookie):
    if len(cookie) > 4096:   # 4096 being the max cookie size
        raise ValueError('Cookie too large.')
    # process cookie
```
### Step 2: Limit Cookie Size

Another way to avoid this vulnerability is to ensure that your web server is set up to reject cookies over a certain size. Here's how you can do this in Node.js:

```javascript
var express = require('express');
var cookieParser = require('cookie-parser');
var app = express();
app.use(cookieParser());

app.use(function (req, res, next) {
  if (req.cookies && req.cookies.length > 4096) {
    res.status(400).send('Cookie too large.');
  }
  else {
    next();
  }
});
```
