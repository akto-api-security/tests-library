# Remediation for KUBELET_DEBUG_EXPOSURE

## Remediation Steps for Kubelet Debug Endpoint Exposure Detection

The Kubelet debug endpoint exposure can allow attackers unauthorized access to sensitive data, or to inject malicious code. This issue is related to the enabling of debugging service on the Kubelet server of Kubernetes.

### Step 1: Disable the Kubelet debug endpoint 

Initially, make sure the debug endpoint is turned off. Here is an example command to update kubelet:

```bash
systemctl edit kubelet.service.d/10-kubeadm.conf
```

Then, add the following line in `[Service]` section:

```text
Environment="KUBELET_EXTRA_ARGS=--anonymous-auth=false"
```

Finally, reload the daemon and restart kubelet:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart kubelet
```

### Step 2: Enable Kubelet Authentication and Authorization

Another remediation step is to ensure that Kubelet's built-in authentication and authorization features are enabled. By default, requests to the Kubelet's HTTPS endpoint are authenticated but not authorized. 

You can restrict access by specifying the `--kubelet-certificate-authority` flag to `kube-apiserver`:

```bash
kube-apiserver ... --kubelet-certificate-authority=/path/to/ca.crt
```

### Step 3: Regular Audit and Update

Maintain a regular audit schedule, and ensure that you are using an updated version of Kubernetes. 

```bash
kubectl version
```

Regular audits help to track any changes and updates provide the latest security measures.

Remember, disable any feature or service that's not necessary for your application to minimize exposure to potential threats.
