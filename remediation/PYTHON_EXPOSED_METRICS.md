# Remediation for PYTHON_EXPOSED_METRICS

## Remediation Steps for Python Exposed Metrics Detection Test

Exposed metrics can be a significant security issue that leads to information leaks about the behavior, usage, and health of your Python service/application. By protecting your metrics endpoints, you can prevent attackers from gaining insight into your system and its vulnerabilities. 

### Step 1: Authenticate Metrics Endpoints
The first step in remediation is to ensure that your metrics endpoints are authenticated. This means that only authorized users can access these endpoints.

Here's an example in Python using Flask HTTP Basic Auth:

```python
from flask import Flask
from flask_httpauth import HTTPBasicAuth
from werkzeug.security import generate_password_hash, check_password_hash

app = Flask(__name__)
auth = HTTPBasicAuth()

users = {
    "admin": generate_password_hash("adminpassword")
}

@auth.verify_password
def verify_password(username, password):
    if username in users and check_password_hash(users.get(username), password):
        return username

@app.route('/metrics')
@auth.login_required
def metrics():
    return 'Metrics data'
```

### Step 2: Limit IP access

Limit the access of metrics to certain trusted IP addresses.

```python
from flask import request

@app.route('/metrics')
def metrics():
    ip = request.remote_addr
    if ip not in trusted_ips:
        abort(403)
    else:
        return 'Metrics data'
```

### Step 3: Regular Review and Update

Perform regular audits on your Python codebase and update dependencies to ensure that you have the latest security updates and patches. This includes checking endpoints to ensure they're properly secured.

```bash
pip list --outdated --format=freeze | grep -v '^\-e' | cut -d = -f 1  | xargs -n1 pip install -U 
```
