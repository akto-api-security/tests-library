## Remediation Steps for Exploiting BOLA by Replacing URL Path with Special Characters for Unauthorized Access

Broken Object Level Authorisation (BOLA) or Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) is a severe application security vulnerability which occurs when an application provides direct access to objects based on user-supplied input. Attackers can use these flaws to bypass authorisation and perform unauthorised actions.

Here we provide steps to remediate this vulnerability:

### Step 1: Always Check Access Rights
Before executing a request, always check if the currently authenticated user has access rights to the requested object.

Without Code:
```
IF user.id HAS permissions FOR object.id THEN
  ALLOW access to object
ELSE
  DENY access to object
ENDIF
```

In Java:
```java
if(authenticatedUser.hasPermission(requestedObject)) {
	executeRequest(requestedObject);
} else {
	throw new PermissionDeniedException();
}
```

### Step 2: Use UUID instead of Sequential IDs
Use UUID instead of sequential IDs as object identifiers. Sequential IDs are easy to guess and can be exploited in IDOR attacks.

```java
import java.util.UUID;
String uniqueID = UUID.randomUUID().toString();
```

### Step 3: Avoid Exposing Sensitive Information in URL
Never expose sensitive information such as file paths or database records, in URL. This can be exploited by attackers to access unauthorized information.

```java
String secureUrl = urlEncoder.encode("/path/to/resource");
```

### Step 4: API Rate Limiting
Apply rate limiting to API endpoints to protect against automated attacks.

Example with Spring Boot:
```java
@Configuration
public class RateLimitConfig {
    @Bean
    public RateLimiter rateLimiter() {
        return RateLimiter.create(1000.0);  // 1000 requests per second 
    }
}
```
