## Remediation Steps for Error Based SQL Injection in PostgreSQL Parameters

Error Based SQL Injection is a serious security issue where an attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code into a database query through parameter manipulation. This can lead to unauthorized data access, data corruption, and in severe cases, data loss.

### Step 1: Parameterize Queries
The first step is to avoid using raw SQL queries with user input. Instead, use parameterized queries where values are added with a placeholder.

Example in Python:

```python
from psycopg2 import sql

def fetch_data(self, conn, parameter):
    cur = conn.cursor()
    cur.execute(sql.SQL("SELECT * FROM table WHERE column = %s"), [parameter])
    return cur.fetchall()

# proper use
record = fetch_data(conn, user_input)
```
This method ensures that the user input is always treated as a literal string inside the query, not a part of the SQL to be executed.

### Step 2: Use Least Privilege Principle

Restrict your database users and only grant necessary permissions. This reduces the potential damage if SQL Injection does occur.

Example:
```bash
GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON tablename TO newuser;
```
### Step 3: As a Safe Guard, Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF)

A WAF can detect and block common web based attacks, like SQL injection, before they reach your application.

Example: Deploy ModSecurity WAF with Apache:
```bash
sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-security2
sudo a2enmod security2
```

### Step 4: Regularly Update and Patch

Ensure to regularly update and patch your database software to mitigate any known vulnerabilities.

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade postgresql
```
Always test these patches in a controlled environment before deploying them into production. 

Remember, no solution is bulletproof, and the best defense against SQL Injection is proper coding practices and regular code audits to find and fix security flaws.
