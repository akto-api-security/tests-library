# Remediation for SSRF_ON_IMAGE_UPLOAD_AWS_REDIRECT

## Remediation Steps for Sensitive AWS Details Exposed via Replacing Image param with Redirection Due to SSRF
The exposure of Sensitive AWS details is a serious security issue. Attackers can gain unauthorized access to AWS assets, effectively compromising your environment.

### Step 1: Validate the Source of Requests

Properly validate the source of all requests. This can help mitigate the risk of a Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack.

In Python, you can install `Flask-security` framework to handle access control. You can specify the URL's which are safe to redirect, avoiding such issues:

```python
from flask_security import Security
from flask_security.utils import safe_str_cmp
from my_project import app, db, user_datastore, login_manager

Security(app, user_datastore)

@login_manager.unauthorized_handler
def unauthorized_callback():
    if request.url:
        return redirect(url_for('user.login', next=request.url))
    else:
        return redirect(url_for('user.login'))
```

### Step 2: Restrict Outbound Traffic from the Web Server

You can limit outbound traffic from your server to AWS IPs only. This will prevent data leakage.

```bash
sudo iptables -I OUTPUT -p tcp -d 0.0.0.0/0 -j DROP
sudo iptables -I OUTPUT -p tcp -d <AWS IPs> -j ACCEPT
```

### Step 3: Whitelist only the Required Endpoints

An additional safeguard against SSRF can be done by implementing a whitelist of URLs the web application can access. This prevents redirection to unauthorized URLs. 

```python
WHITELISTED_IPS = ['127.0.0.1', 'localhost', '<AWS IPs>']

def is_whitelisted(url):
    return any(ip in url for ip in WHITELISTED_IPS)
```

### Step 4: Least Privilege Access

Assign each instance of your application with an IAM Role that has the least privilege access. This mitigates the risk associated with exposing sensitive details.

For example, using AWS CLI you can create a role with limited permission:

```bash
aws iam create-role --role-name my-role --assume-role-policy-document file://TrustPolicyForEC2.json

aws iam put-role-policy --role-name my-role --policy-name limited-permissions --policy-document file://LimitedPermissions.json
```

### Step 5: Regular Audit and Update

Regularly reviewing access logs and updating IAM roles and Security Groups will help keep your security posture up-to-date.
