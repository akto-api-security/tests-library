## Remediation Steps for Command Injection in Cookie Header

Command injection in Cookie Header is a severe security issue that could allow an attacker to inject malicious commands via cookies, which could potentially compromise the entire web application.

### Step 1: Validate cookie values
Ensure you're validating cookie values by only allowing strictly defined values. Using regex patterns can be a viable way to achieve this.

For instance, in python:

```python
import re

def is_valid_cookie(cookie_value):
    pattern = re.compile("^[a-zA-Z0-9]{1,40}$")
    return bool(pattern.match(cookie_value))
```

In the example above, we're exclusively allowing alphanumeric characters and setting an upper limit of 40 characters for cookie values.

### Step 2: Encode and Escape Special Characters

Special characters used in commands should be properly encoded or escaped to prevent arbitrary command execution.

For instance, in JavaScript:

```javascript
function escapeCookie(cookieValue){
    return encodeURIComponent(cookieValue);
}
```
In the above JavaScript example, encodeURIComponent() function is used to encode special characters, potentially harmful for command execution.

### Step 3: Use HTTPOnly Cookies 

Enabling HTTPOnly attribute for cookies will prevent cookie theft via cross-site scripting (XSS), which could also be used to execute commands.

Here's how to do that in PHP:

```php
setcookie('CookieName', 'CookieValue', ['httponly' => true]);
```
