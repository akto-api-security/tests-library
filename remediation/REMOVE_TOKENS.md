# Remediation for REMOVE_TOKENS

## Remediation Steps for Broken Authentication by Removing Auth Token
Broken authentication involving auth tokens can lead to unauthorized access if not addressed correctly. Below is a simple remediation strategy using Java with Spring Security.

### Step 1: Check Already Available Authentication
First, check whether authentication is already active for the intended use.

```java
Authentication auth = SecurityContextHolder.getContext().getAuthentication();
```

### Step 2: Define Authentication Object
If authentication isn't available, define an `Authentication` object. Here we'll use `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken`.

```java
Authentication authentication = new UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken(username, password);
```

### Step 3: Implement Authentication Manager
Use an `AuthenticationManager` to validate the `Authentication` object.

```java
AuthenticationManager authenticationManager;
Authentication auth = authenticationManager.authenticate(authentication);
```

### Step 4: Set Authenticated User Context
If authentication is successful, store it in the `SecurityContext`.

```java
if(auth.isAuthenticated()){
    SecurityContextHolder.getContext().setAuthentication(auth);
}
```

### Step 5: Logging Out and Removing Auth Token
To log out the authenticated user, nullify the `Authentication` object in `SecurityContext`.

```java
SecurityContextHolder.getContext().setAuthentication(null);
```

### Step 6: Regular Audit and Update
Lastly, always ensure you audit your security measures regularly and update as necessary.

```java
//This will depend on your organizational setting, no specific code.
```

Note: This is just a simple guide to remediation. Actual implementation may vary based on your organizational requirements and security considerations. Always ensure your steps are tailored to your use-cases and thoroughly tested.
