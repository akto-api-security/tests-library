## Remediation Steps for Log4j Vulnerability

The vulnerability in Apache's Log4j library, a very popular logging package in the Java ecosystem, allows an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary code. The vulnerability is especially dangerous because it can be triggered from various innocent-looking places inside your application like HTTP request parameters.

### Step 1: Update to the Latest Version
The first and most basic step you can take is to update to the latest version of Log4j.

```bash
<!-- First, find out your current version -->
mvn dependency:list | grep 'log4j'

<!-- Next, update log4j to the latest version in your Maven project -->
mvn versions:use-latest-versions -Dincludes=org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core 

<!-- Or if you're using Gradel, update to the latest version like so -->
dependencies {
    compile group: 'org.apache.logging.log4j', name: 'log4j-core', version: '2.15.0'
}
```

### Step 2: Manually Invalidate JNDI 

If you can't update the library immediately, a workaround is to set the system property `log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups` to `true`.

```bash
java -Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true ...
```

Or you can add the following line to your applicationâ€™s startup scripts:

```bash
System.setProperty("log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups", "true");
```

### Step 3: Limit Incoming Connections

Limit incoming connections to your application as much as possible so that an attacker does not have the chance to exploit the vulnerability.
