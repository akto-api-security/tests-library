## Remediation Steps for 2FA Bypass with Brute-force Attack

A two-factor authentication (2FA) bypass occurs when an attacker is able to circumvent the two-factor authentication process. This is a serious security issue which may possibly lead to unauthorized access. Brute-force attacks are a way that an attacker can bypass this level of security, attempting many passcodes until they find the correct one.

### Step 1: Implement Rate Limiting

Use rate limiting to limit the number of attempts a user can make. This will help prevent brute force attacks.

For instance, in a Java based application, you could use the Spring Boot's `@EnableRateLimiting` annotation.

```java
@Configuration
@EnableRateLimiting
public class RateLimitConfig {
    @Bean
    RateLimiter rateLimiter() {
        return new InMemoryRateLimiter();
    }
}
```

### Step 2: Use CAPTCHA

Use a CAPTCHA for the users to confirm that they are not a robot. It helps in preventing automated software or bots from doing malicious activities.

Example using Node.js with express-recaptcha:

```javascript
const { ReCaptchaV2 } = require('express-recaptcha');
const recaptcha = new ReCaptchaV2({ siteKey: 'siteKey', secretKey: 'secretKey' });

app.get('/login', recaptcha.middleware.render, (req, res) => {
    // use recaptcha in view
    res.render('login', { captcha:res.recaptcha });
});
```

### Step 3: Set Up Account Lockouts

An account lockout policy will disable a user account if an incorrect password is entered a certain number of times over a certain period. This will prevent brute-force attacks from happening.

Here's a basic example in Python, using Django's `django-axes` package:

```python
# settings.py

AXES_LOCK_OUT_AT_FAILURE = True
AXES_COOLOFF_TIME = 1  # time in hours
```
