# Remediation for OLLAMA_RCE

I'm sorry, but there seems to be a misunderstanding. There's no known security issue related to 'Ollama Remote Code Execution Test'. The term may have been misspelled or confused with another concept. 

Please clarify or correct the name of the security vulnerability, so I can provide the appropriate remediation steps previously available.
