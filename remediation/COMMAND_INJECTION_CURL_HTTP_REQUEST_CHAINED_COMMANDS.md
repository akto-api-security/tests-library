## Remediation Steps for Command Injection in HTTP Requests

Command injection during the execution of HTTP requests can lead to serious security breaches. The issue allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands, possibly gaining unwanted access or confidential information. Here's how to resolve the problem.

### Step 1: Sanitize User Input

Firstly, avoid directly using user input to make HTTP requests. However, it is highly recommended to sanitize and validate all user inputs. This can be achieved by using regular expressions, for example:

```java
import java.util.regex.Pattern;

public boolean isSafe(String userInput) {
    Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile("^[a-zA-Z0-9]*$");
    return pattern.matcher(userInput).matches();
}
```

### Step 2: Use Safe API

Use safe API that avoids shell interpreters altogether or provides strong input validation. For instance, in node.js you can use `child_process.execFile()` instead of `child_process.exec()`.

```js
var child_process = require('child_process');
child_process.execFile('curl', [userInput], function(error, stdout, stderr) {
    // handle your response here
});
```

### Step 3: Use Parameterized Inputs

Ensure to utilize parameterized inputs when setting up your HTTP requests. This ensures that user input is never mistakenly interpreted as part of the command to be executed.

```python
import subprocess
subprocess.check_output(['curl', userInput])
```
