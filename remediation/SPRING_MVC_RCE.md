# Remediation for SPRING_MVC_RCE

## Remediation Steps for Spring MVC Remote Code Execution

Spring MVC Remote Code Execution is a severe security vulnerability. If left unaddressed, attackers can execute malicious code remotely on your system. This may lead to unwanted system behavior or even further security issues.

### Step 1: Upgrade to a Non-Vulnerable Version

One of the most straightforward remediation steps is to upgrade your Spring Framework to a version that is not vulnerable to this issue. 

```bash
mvn versions:use-latest-versions -Dincludes=org.springframework:spring-webmvc
```
Then, run your Spring Boot application as usual.

### Step 2: Input Validation and Sanitization

Input validation and sanitization is crucial to preventing remote code execution attacks. Make sure that all user inputs are validated, and illegal characters are sanitized.

```java
public String sanitizeUserInput(String userInput) {
    return HtmlUtils.htmlEscape(userInput);
}
```
### Step 3: Implement Content Security Policy

A Content Security Policy (CSP) is an added layer of security that helps to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, including Cross Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks.

```java
@Configuration
public class WebSecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {
    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http
            //...
            .headers()
                .contentSecurityPolicy("script-src 'self'");
    }
}
```
