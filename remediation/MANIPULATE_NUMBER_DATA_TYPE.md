# Remediation for MANIPULATE_NUMBER_DATA_TYPE

## Remediation Steps for Manipulate Number Data Type Vulnerability

Manipulation of Number Data Type in systems can lead to serious security issues, including violation of data integrity and unauthorized access to resources. Here are remediation steps to rectify this vulnerability:

### Step 1: Proper Input Validation

Always perform appropriate user-input validation. Check whether an input value is a number using available library functions or custom validation methods.  

For a JavaScript program, use `isNaN(value)` to check if a value is not a number.

```javascript
let value = user_input;
if(isNaN(value)){
  console.log("Invalid Input");
  return;
}
```

### Step 2: Use Safe Numeric Operations 

Always use safe numerical operations libraries or functions to avoid Number Data Type manipulation vulnerabilities.

In Python, you can use `decimal` library to perform secure numeric operations.

```python
from decimal import Decimal

# Use Decimal instead of float for secure operations
val = Decimal(user_input)
```
