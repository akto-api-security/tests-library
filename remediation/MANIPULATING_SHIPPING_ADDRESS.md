# Remediation for MANIPULATING_SHIPPING_ADDRESS

## Remediation Steps for Manipulating Shipping Address Issue

Manipulating shipping address is a significant security issue. If not properly secured, attackers can manipulate the shipping address to misdirect the orders, leading to potential loss.

### Step 1: Validate Address Entry on Client Side

Perform validation checks at the client side using JavaScript before the form data is submitted. This prevents user from entering anything other than valid shipping address.

```javascript
let addressField = document.getElementById("shippingAddress");
addressField.onchange = function(){
  // Replace with actual valid pattern
  let pattern = /[Valid Shipping Address Pattern]/;
  if(!pattern.test(addressField.value)){
    alert("Invalid Shipping Address!");
    addressField.value = "";
  }
}
```
### Step 2: Validate Address on Server Side

Even if the client-side validation is bypassed, the server-side validation should counteract this. It can be done for example through PHP.

```php
<?php
$shippingAddress = $_POST['shippingAddress'];
if (!preg_match("/[Valid Shipping Address Pattern]/", $shippingAddress)) {
  die('Error: Invalid Shipping Address');
}
?>
```

### Step 3: Implement Robust Access Control

Ensure that only authenticated and authorized users can update the shipping address. This can be done, for instance, through session management.
  
```php
session_start();
if (!isset($_SESSION['loggedin']) || $_SESSION['loggedin'] !==true){
    header('location: login.php');
    exit;
}
```

### Step 4: Use HTTPS

Utilize HTTPS to ensure that the connection between the client and the server is encrypted, preventing Man-in-the-Middle attacks.

### Step 5: Regular Audit and Update

Regularly audit your application for any security loophole and keep your system updated.
