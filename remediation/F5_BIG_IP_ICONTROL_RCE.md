## Remediation Steps for F5 BIG-IP iControl REST Auth Bypass RCE

F5 BIG-IP iControl REST vulnerability allows for authentication bypass and remote code execution. Attackers may exploit this vulnerability to take complete control of the system. Following these steps will help mitigate the risk.

### Step 1: Apply Security Patches

F5 Networks has released security updates to address this vulnerability. Apply the relevant patches for your version.

```bash
# Login as root
su -

# Update all packages to the latest version
tmsh
modify sys global-settings mgmt-dhcp disabled
save sys config
reboot

# After reboot, check your version
show sys version
```

### Step 2: Block Unauthorized Access

Implement Access Control Lists (ACLs) or firewall rules to block unauthorized access to the management interface and Self IPs.

```bash
modify /net self <self IP name> allow-service replace-all-with { default }
```

### Step 3: Ensure Secure Access

Use secure protocols (like HTTPS) and enforce strong password policies for better security.

```bash
modify auth password-policy minimum-length 10
modify auth password-policy enforce-complexity enabled
```

### Step 4: Regular Monitoring and Audit

Ensure regular system updates and conduct regular audits for suspicious activities.

```bash
show sys software
show sys audit | i err
```
