## Remediation Steps for Advanced Union based SQL Injection 

Advanced Union based SQL Injection is a type of web vulnerability that allows an attacker to manipulate a SQL query to extract sensitive information or execute arbitrary code in the database. The injection takes advantage of unfiltered or poorly filtered user inputs that are directly passed to a SQL query. 

Here are the steps to mitigate such injection attacks:

### Step 1: Use Parameterized Queries

Parameterized queries ensure that placeholders are used in SQL queries instead of directly inserting user inputs into the query. This way, even if an attacker tries to inject malicious SQL content, the database will treat it as a string and not as a SQL command. Below is a Python example using the psycopg2 library:

```python
import psycopg2
conn = psycopg2.connect(database="mydb", user="myuser", password="mypassword")
cur = conn.cursor()
cur.execute("SELECT * FROM Users WHERE name = %s", (user_input,))
```

### Step 2: Use ORM (Object Relational Mapping) 

Most modern programming languages have support for ORM libraries. These libraries intrinsically avoid SQL Injections and reduce the development time:

```python
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker
Session = sessionmaker(bind=some_engine)
session = Session()
user = session.query(User).filter_by(name=user_input).first()
```

### Step 3: Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF)

Using a WAF can help to filter or monitor HTTP(S) traffic and block any suspicious activity:

```bash
sudo apt-get install modsecurity-crs
```
