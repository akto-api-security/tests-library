# Remediation for ANSIBLE_CONFIG_EXPOSURE

## Remediation Steps for Ansible Configuration Page Exposure

Ansible Configuration Page Exposure is a significant security vulnerability. If not addressed, it can allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information of your Ansible configurations. Here are the steps to remediate this issue:

### Step 1: Restrict Access to Ansible Configuration Files

Restrict the access to Ansible configuration files so that only authorized users can read them.

```bash
sudo chmod 600 /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
```

### Step 2: Enable Ansible Vault

Use Ansible Vault to encrypt sensitive data. This ensures that your sensitive information is secure.

```bash
ansible-vault encrypt_string 'your sensitive data' --name 'variable name'
```

### Step 3: Set Ansible Configuration Environment Variable

Set the ANSIBLE_CONFIG environment variable to point to a secure location.

```bash
export ANSIBLE_CONFIG=/path/to/your/ansible.cfg
```

### Step 4: Scan Regularly and Update

Regularly scan and update the Ansible configurations to ensure there are no potential security risks.

```bash
ansible-playbook -i hosts playbook.yml --check
```

### Step 5: Secure SSH Keys

Never store SSH keys in your Ansible playbooks or roles. Keep them in a secure location and only use them when necessary.

```bash
ssh-add /path/to/your/private.key
ansible-playbook -i hosts playbook.yml --ask-vault-pass
```
          
Remember to replace `'your sensitive data'`, `'variable name'`, `/path/to/your/ansible.cfg` and `/path/to/your/private.key` in the above examples with your actual data, variable name, and paths respectively.
