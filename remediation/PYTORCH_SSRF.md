# Remediation for PYTORCH_SSRF

## Remediation Steps for PyTorch Server-Side Request Forgery Test
Server-Side Request Forgery, or SSRF, is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to make requests on behalf of the server. In the context of a PyTorch server, without proper security measures, attackers might exploit such a vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to services that are internal to your network.

Here are steps to mitigate such vulnerabilities:

### Step 1: Validate All Inputs
First, ensure that all server inputs are properly validated and sanitized before use. This can help to mitigate SSRF and many other types of security vulnerabilities.

Consider using a Python function to validate URLs before making requests with them.
```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse

def is_valid_url(url):
    try:
        result = urlparse(url)
        return all([result.scheme, result.netloc])
    except ValueError:
        return False
```

### Step 2: Restrict Network Access
Network restrictions on the PyTorch server can help prevent access to certain sensitive internal systems. Limit the access of your PyTorch server only to systems it needs to interact with. 

In Python, you can make use of the requests library and explicitly allow or disallow certain IP ranges using the 'allow' keyword.
```python
allow = ['192.168.0.0/16']

def is_allowed_ip(ip):
    for ip_range in allow:
        if ip in IPNetwork(ip_range):
             return True
    return False
```

### Step 3: Use a Safe List
Create a Safe List of URLs that the server can interact with. Any URL that is not on the Safe List should be rejected.

```python
SAFE_URLS = ['http://example1.com', 'http://example2.com']

def is_safe_url(url):
    if url in SAFE_URLS:
        return True
    return False
```
