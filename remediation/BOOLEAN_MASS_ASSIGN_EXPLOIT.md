# Remediation for BOOLEAN_MASS_ASSIGN_EXPLOIT

## Remediation Steps for Mass Assignment Using Boolean Values

Mass Assignment is a security vulnerability that occurs when an attacker is able to set the values of model attributes they are not supposed to. 

This can potentially lead to unauthorized data access, data corruption and even privilege escalation.

Here is how to possibly remediate this vulnerability:

### Step 1: Whitelist Model Attributes
Whitelist the model attributes that you want to expose for mass assignment. In a Ruby on Rails application, you can use `attr_accessible` method to whitelist attributes. 

```ruby
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  attr_accessible :name, :email
end
```

### Step 2: Use Strong Parameters
In some frameworks like Ruby on Rails, you can use `strong parameters` to prevent mass assignment. This requires you to explicitly state which parameters are allowed for mass update in your controllers.

For instance: 
```ruby
def user_params
  params.require(:user).permit(:name, :email)
end
```

### Step 3: Update your Codebase
Thoroughly review your codebase for potential mass assignment vulnerabilities and apply the above steps accordingly.

### Step 4: Regular Audit and Update
Regularly audit your application and try to keep informed about new potential vulnerabilities to mitigate any possible issue beforehand. 

```bash
bundle audit check --update
```

Remember, security is an ongoing endeavor and staying vigilant towards the latest vulnerabilities is one of the best ways to keep your application safe.
