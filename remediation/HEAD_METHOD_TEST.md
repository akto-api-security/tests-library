# Remediation for HEAD_METHOD_TEST

## Remediation Steps for Access Control Bypass by Changing Request Method to HEAD
Access control bypass by changing the request method is a significant security risk that allows attackers to bypass intended restrictions and potentially gain unauthorized access to resources.

### Step 1: Implement Checks for Request Method
Ensure that your application checks not only the path and parameters of the incoming request, but also the method with which it was sent. 
This can be implemented in many languages, but the core logic should remain the same. Below is a sample snippet in Node.js (with Express framework).

```javascript
app.use((req, res, next) => {
    if (req.method === 'HEAD') {
        return res.status(405).send('Method Not Allowed');
    }
    next();
});
```

### Step 2: Use HTTP Methods Appropriately
Define what methods each endpoint should respond to and reject all others. This can be enforced in Express.js with routes defined for only the appropriate methods. For example:

```javascript
app.get('/example', (req, res) => { /* ... */ });
app.post('/example', (req, res) => { /* ... */ });
// HEAD requests to /example will result in a 404 Not Found
```
