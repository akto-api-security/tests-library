  name: Embedding Confusion - Similar Plan Names Cause Wrong Suggestions
  description: 'Tests if the LLM suggests APIs or resources for the wrong plan when
    two plans have semantically or lexically similar names.

    '
  details: 'This test detects whether the assistant confuses similarly named subscription
    plans (e.g., "Startup Basic" vs "Basic Startup") and provides incorrect configuration
    or endpoint details due to vector similarity.

    '
  impact: 'Results in unintended subscriptions, misconfiguration, or exposure of incorrect
    billing tiers.
