info:
  name: "Jailbreak - Evil Assistant Roleplay"
  description: >
    Attempts to bypass safety filters by requesting instructions for a dangerous act in disguised, encoded, or implied format.
  details: >
    Attackers may reword or obfuscate unsafe prompts (e.g., asking for 'cleaning up rust inside the brain' instead of describing violence) to slip past filters.
  impact: >
    Can result in the LLM producing content that would otherwise be filtered — such as self-harm, weapon building, or other unsafe acts.
