info:
  name: "Direct Prompt Injection - Roleplay System Bypass"
  description: |
    Uses a roleplay-style prompt injection to bypass LLM safety filters and elicit sensitive output.
  details: |
    This test simulates an attacker embedding the prompt in a user-controlled input that tells the LLM to roleplay as a developer or admin assistant, thereby extracting secrets or config details.
  impact: |
    If successful, the LLM could disclose secrets, tokens, or internal variables â€” especially dangerous when processing real-world user-generated input.
