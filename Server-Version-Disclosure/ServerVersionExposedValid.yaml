info:
  name: Server Version Exposed Via Response Header
  description: "Attacker can obtain information about the software version and other identifying details of the server software running on a remote system."
  details: >
    "The endpoint appears to be vulnerable to server version disclosure attack. The original request
    was replayed by modifying it with an invalid url. The server response contained a header named Server  which contained information about the server software and its version number.
    "<b>Background:</b> Server version disclosure vulnerabilities are often considered low-risk compared  to other types of security flaws. However, they can still provide attackers with valuable information  that aids in the planning and execution of subsequent attacks. For example, knowing the specific version  of a web server software can help an attacker identify publicly known vulnerabilities associated with  that version and exploit them to gain unauthorized access to the server or compromise its integrity.
