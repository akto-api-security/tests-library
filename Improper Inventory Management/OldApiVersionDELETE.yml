info:
  name: "Old API Version Test for detecting shadow APIs with DELETE method"
  description: "This test involves evaluating legacy API versions with DELETE method to identify and address any shadow APIs—those that are not documented or officially sanctioned but still in use. This test helps ensure that deprecated or unauthorized APIs do not pose security risks or cause inconsistencies within the system. By detecting and managing shadow APIs, organizations can maintain better control over their API landscape and improve overall security and compliance."
  details: "This test is a process where outdated API versions with DELETE method are examined to uncover shadow APIs—unauthorized or undocumented endpoints that may be in use within a system. This testing typically involves scanning for old API endpoints and analyzing their usage patterns to ensure they don't bypass current security measures or introduce vulnerabilities. By identifying these hidden APIs, organizations can take corrective actions to secure their systems and maintain accurate API documentation and control."
  impact: "The impact of this test is significant for system security and compliance. Detecting and managing shadow APIs helps prevent unauthorized access, reduce security risks, and ensure that outdated endpoints do not compromise the integrity of the system. By addressing these hidden APIs, organizations can enhance their security posture, improve data protection, and ensure that all APIs adhere to current policies and standards."
