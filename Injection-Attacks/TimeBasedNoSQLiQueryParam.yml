  name: "Time based NoSQL Injection test for Query Parameters with Javascript"
  description: >
    "Time-based NoSQL injection testing involves manipulating query parameters to include time delays in the responses. By injecting conditions that cause the database to pause before responding, attackers can infer whether the application is vulnerable based on the delay. This technique helps identify weaknesses in how the application handles query execution and can reveal potential security risks in NoSQL databases."
  details: >
    "Time-based NoSQL injection involves inserting payloads into query parameters that trigger intentional delays or time-based operations in the database response. Testers use this method to determine if the application's response time changes based on the injected conditions, indicating potential vulnerabilities. By analyzing these delays, testers can assess how the application handles and processes queries, revealing weaknesses in input validation and query logic."
  impact: >
    "The impact of time-based NoSQL injection can be severe, potentially allowing attackers to infer sensitive data or manipulate the application's behavior through response delays. This method can lead to performance degradation, unauthorized access, or exposure of internal system workings. It also poses risks of data breaches and system compromise if attackers exploit these vulnerabilities to bypass security controls or disrupt normal operations."
