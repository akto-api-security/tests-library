info:
  name: XML Debug Mode Injection
  description: >
    "XML Debug Mode Injection occurs when an attacker injects XML data that enables debug or verbose logging in the application. This injection can reveal sensitive information, internal error messages, or other debug output that should not be exposed to users."
  details: >
    "In this attack, an attacker manipulates the XML input to activate the application's debug mode, often by including parameters like `<debug>true</debug>`. If the application does not properly validate this input and accepts such modifications, it may expose internal debug information in the response, revealing sensitive data, configurations, or underlying system details. These details can help attackers to further exploit the system."
  impact: >
    "Exposing the application's debug or verbose mode can result in sensitive information disclosure, including system configuration details, internal error messages, stack traces, or other data that can aid in further attacks. It may also lead to privacy violations and provide attackers with valuable insights into the application's logic and weaknesses, potentially leading to more severe exploits."
