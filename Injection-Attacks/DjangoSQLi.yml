info:
  name: "Django SQL Injection"
  description: "This refers to a vulnerability in Django applications where attackers can manipulate SQL queries through unsanitized input. This occurs when user input is improperly handled, allowing malicious SQL code to be executed on the database. Exploiting this vulnerability can lead to unauthorized data access, data manipulation, or even complete database compromise. Properly using Django's ORM and validating user input can help mitigate this risk."
  details:  "Django SQL Injection vulnerabilities typically arise from the improper use of raw SQL queries or concatenating user inputs directly into query strings. Attackers can inject SQL commands that modify the intended logic of queries, potentially exposing sensitive data or allowing unauthorized operations. Common scenarios include poorly validated URL parameters, form inputs, or API requests that are directly included in SQL statements. Developers should use parameterized queries or Django's built-in ORM features to prevent such injections effectively."
  impact: "Successful exploitation of a Django SQL Injection vulnerability can lead to severe consequences, including unauthorized access to sensitive data, data manipulation, or even complete system compromise. Attackers may extract user credentials, personally identifiable information (PII), or other confidential data from the database. In critical scenarios, they could gain administrative privileges, allowing them to alter application functionality or disrupt services. Overall, the impact can severely damage the application's integrity, confidentiality, and availability."
