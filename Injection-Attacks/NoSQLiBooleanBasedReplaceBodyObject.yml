  name: "Boolean Based NoSQL Injection test by replacing JSON body with Object"
  description: >
    "Boolean-based NoSQL injection testing by replacing the JSON body with an object involves injecting malicious objects into the query to manipulate its logical evaluation. For example, replacing a JSON parameter with an object tests if the application correctly handles and sanitizes such inputs. If the query returns unintended results, it indicates a vulnerability. This method helps identify weaknesses in the application's input validation, potentially exposing the system to unauthorized data access and manipulation."
  details: >
    "Boolean-based NoSQL injection testing by replacing the JSON body with an object involves substituting a JSON field with an object that changes the query logic. For instance, injecting object can alter the query to return all records where the field is not empty. This tests the application's ability to handle and sanitize complex object inputs. If the query behavior changes as a result, it indicates a vulnerability, highlighting the need for robust input validation to prevent unauthorized data access and potential data manipulation."
  impact: >
    "The impact of Boolean-based NoSQL injection testing by replacing the JSON body with an object can be significant. If the application is vulnerable, attackers can manipulate queries to bypass filters, access sensitive data, and perform unauthorized actions. This can lead to data breaches, loss of data integrity, and exposure of confidential information. Identifying such vulnerabilities underscores the importance of proper input validation and sanitization to safeguard against injection attacks and ensure the security and integrity of the application."
