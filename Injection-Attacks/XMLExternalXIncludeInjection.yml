info:
  name: XML External XInclude Injection
  description: >
    "XML External XInclude Injection occurs when an attacker exploits the XInclude feature in XML to include external entities or files into the XML document. This allows attackers to access local files or remote resources that should not be accessible through the application, leading to potential data leakage or system compromise."
  details: >
    "The XInclude mechanism in XML allows external data to be included in an XML document. An attacker can manipulate the input to include external files (e.g., sensitive system files like `/etc/passwd`) or remote resources into the XML document. If the application processes this injected content without proper validation, it can result in the disclosure of sensitive information or unintended behaviors."
  impact: >
    "XML External XInclude Injection can lead to significant security issues, such as unauthorized access to sensitive files, exposure of configuration data, or the ability to manipulate the application's logic. In severe cases, it may even lead to remote code execution or compromise of the underlying system, especially if the included external content is malicious or contains system-critical information."
