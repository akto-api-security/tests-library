info:
  name: "Time based NoSQL Injection test for JSON body Parameters with Javascript"
  description: >
    "Time-based NoSQL injection testing for JSON body parameters involves inserting payloads with time-based logic into JSON data sent in requests. By causing intentional delays in how the NoSQL database processes these inputs, attackers can observe response times to detect vulnerabilities. This testing method helps uncover weaknesses in how the application handles and interprets JSON body parameters, revealing potential security risks in NoSQL queries."
  details: >
    "In time-based NoSQL injection testing for JSON body parameters, testers inject payloads designed to introduce delays or time-based operations within the JSON data. By analyzing how the database's response time varies with different inputs, they can determine if the application is vulnerable to such injections. This approach helps identify flaws in how JSON body parameters are processed and validated, highlighting potential security vulnerabilities in the handling of NoSQL queries."
  impact: >
    "The impact of time-based NoSQL injection on JSON body parameters can lead to severe security issues, such as unauthorized access or manipulation of data. Attackers might exploit response delays to infer sensitive information or disrupt application performance. This vulnerability can compromise data integrity, reveal internal logic, and potentially allow for broader exploitation or denial-of-service attacks."
