  name: "XML External Entity (XXE) test on SOAP API for Log File Disclosure"
  description: >
    "This test involves exploiting XML parsing vulnerabilities to extract and reveal sensitive log file contents, potentially exposing critical information about the SOAP API's activities and system logs."
  details: >
    "Conducting an XML External Entity (XXE) test on SOAP API for Log File Disclosure entails manipulating XML structures to unveil confidential log file contents, providing adversaries with insights into SOAP API activities and potential security implications."
  impact: >
    "Successful XML External Entity (XXE) test on SOAP API for Log File Disclosure can lead to unauthorized access to critical log file contents, exposing potential security vulnerabilities, and compromising the integrity of SOAP API activities with implications for system security."
