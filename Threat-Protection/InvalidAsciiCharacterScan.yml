  name: "Unicode Characters Outside ASCII Printable Range"
  description: "Detects presence of Unicode characters outside the printable ASCII range in incoming API requests. This can indicate encoding attacks, obfuscation, or attempts to bypass input validation mechanisms."
  details: "Printable ASCII characters range from 0x20 (space) to 0x7E (~). Characters outside this range may include control characters, non-English letters, or special Unicode symbols. These characters are often used to evade filters or deliver payloads in a concealed format. Detection of such characters helps prevent encoding attacks, injection attempts, or malformed request abuse."
  impact: "Payloads containing non-printable or non-ASCII characters may be used in encoding attacks, data smuggling, or to evade signature-based security mechanisms. These characters can compromise parsers, lead to security bypasses, or trigger unexpected behavior in backend services."
