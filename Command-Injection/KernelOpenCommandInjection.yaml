  name: "Kernel open command injection in Ruby"
  description: "Replacing request parameters with bash commands in a Ruby on Rails app test can lead to command injection due to the use of 'Kernel#open' and the presence of shell injection vulnerability." 
  details: >
            "During the testing of a Ruby on Rails app, if a request parameter containing a URL is processed using 'Kernel#open' by the developers, it introduces a vulnerability to command injection.
            This allows an attacker to exploit the design flaw by sending a pipe character followed by a shell command. The impact of successful command injection includes unauthorized access, data leakage, system compromise, and potential disruption of services,
            making it a critical security concern that needs immediate attention."
  impact: "Command injection allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on a vulnerable system, leading to unauthorized access, data theft, system compromise, and potential disruption of services, making it a severe security risk."
