info:
  name: "Apache Druid Remote Code Execution"
  description: "This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected Druid servers. This issue arises from improper handling of user inputs or vulnerabilities in the server's code execution paths. Exploiting this flaw, an attacker could gain control over the server, leading to potential data breaches, system compromise, and unauthorized manipulation of Druidâ€™s operations and data."
  details:  "This vulnerability stems from insecure handling of user input or flawed code execution mechanisms within Apache Druid. Attackers can exploit this flaw by sending crafted requests or data to the Druid server, leading to arbitrary code execution. This can be achieved through improperly validated inputs or unpatched components, allowing the attacker to execute commands or scripts on the server, potentially leading to system compromise or unauthorized access."
  impact: "The impact of this vulnerability is severe, as it allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on the affected server. This can lead to full control over the server, enabling unauthorized access to sensitive data, manipulation of Druid operations, and potential compromise of the entire system. The breach could result in data loss, system downtime, and broader security implications for the organization's infrastructure."
