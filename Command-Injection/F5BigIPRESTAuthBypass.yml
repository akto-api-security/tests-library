info:
  name: F5 BIG-IP iControl - REST Auth Bypass RCE
  description: "This vulnerability allows attackers to bypass authentication in F5 BIG-IP's iControl REST interface, leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE). By exploiting this flaw, attackers can execute arbitrary commands on the system with elevated privileges. This critical vulnerability, if left unpatched, can lead to full system compromise, allowing control over sensitive infrastructure and data."
  details:  "This vulnerability allows attackers to bypass authentication mechanisms in the iControl REST API, gaining unauthorized access to the system. By leveraging this access, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands remotely, potentially taking full control of the affected F5 BIG-IP system. This vulnerability affects specific versions of BIG-IP and requires immediate patching to mitigate the risk of exploitation."
  impact: "The impact of this vulnerability is severe, as it allows attackers to bypass authentication and execute arbitrary code with system-level privileges. This can lead to complete control of the affected system, enabling data theft, service disruption, or further attacks on other connected infrastructure. If exploited, it poses a critical risk to the integrity and security of the entire network environment."
