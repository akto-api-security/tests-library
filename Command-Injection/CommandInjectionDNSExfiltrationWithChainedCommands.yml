info:
  name: "Command injection for DNS Exfiltration with chained system instruction in HTTP request parameters"
  description: "Command injection for DNS exfiltration with chained system instructions in HTTP request parameters involves exploiting vulnerabilities to leak sensitive data through DNS queries. Attackers inject malicious commands into HTTP request parameters, which are then processed to perform DNS lookups that encode and transmit data. By chaining these commands, attackers can exfiltrate information by embedding it in DNS requests, bypassing traditional security measures and enabling data theft or unauthorized access."
  details: >
    "Command injection for DNS exfiltration with chained system instructions in HTTP request parameters involves injecting commands into HTTP parameters to execute DNS queries that exfiltrate data. Attackers embed sensitive information into DNS requests by chaining commands that perform lookups to a malicious server. This technique exploits vulnerabilities in how the application handles HTTP parameters, enabling attackers to covertly transmit data in DNS queries and bypass traditional security controls designed to protect against data leakage."
  impact: "The impact of command injection for DNS exfiltration with chained system instructions in HTTP request parameters can be significant, as it allows attackers to covertly transmit sensitive data through DNS queries. This method can bypass conventional security measures and data loss prevention systems, leading to unauthorized data access and exfiltration. By embedding data in DNS requests, attackers can achieve stealthy data theft, potentially exposing critical information and compromising the confidentiality and integrity of the affected systems."
