info:
  name: "Command injection for information gathering with HTTP requests with curl and chained system instructions"
  description: "Command injection for information gathering with HTTP requests using curl involves attackers injecting malicious commands into a vulnerable input field to execute curl requests. This allows them to fetch and retrieve sensitive data from internal or external servers. By exploiting this vulnerability, attackers can gather valuable information that aids in further compromising the target system."
  details: >
    "Command injection for information gathering with `curl` and chained system instructions involves injecting malicious commands into HTTP requests sent by `curl`. Attackers exploit vulnerabilities to send crafted requests, which include additional commands chained together. These commands can be used to process and analyze the responses from web services, perform system queries, or extract information from the server. This technique allows attackers to gather detailed insights into the system, network, or application, potentially revealing sensitive data and aiding in further exploitation."
  impact: "The impact of command injection for information gathering with `curl` and chained system instructions can be severe, as it enables attackers to collect detailed and potentially sensitive information from the target system. By injecting and chaining commands, attackers can gather data about system configurations, user details, or application behaviors, which can be used for further exploitation. This technique can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and enhanced reconnaissance capabilities, significantly compromising the security and integrity of the target environment."
