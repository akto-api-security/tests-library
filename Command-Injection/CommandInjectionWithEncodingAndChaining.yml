  name: "Command injection by chaining system commands and using Encoding and Character Manipulation"
  description: "Command injection by chaining system commands with encoding and character manipulation involves exploiting vulnerabilities to execute commands in a sequence while bypassing input validation. Attackers use techniques like encoding payloads (e.g., URL encoding) and manipulating special characters to evade security filters and inject malicious commands. This method allows for sophisticated attacks by combining multiple commands and using encoded or obfuscated inputs to gain unauthorized access or control over the system."
  details: >
    "Command injection by chaining system commands with encoding and character manipulation exploits vulnerabilities by combining multiple commands and disguising them with encoding techniques. Attackers might use URL encoding or base64 encoding to obfuscate payloads, allowing them to bypass input filters. For example, they could inject a sequence of commands separated by ;, with some commands encoded to evade detection. This approach can lead to complex attacks, including unauthorized access and system control, by leveraging encoded input to exploit security weaknesses and execute malicious operations."
  impact: "The impact of command injection through chaining and encoding can be severe, as it enables attackers to bypass security mechanisms and execute a series of malicious commands. By using encoding and character manipulation, attackers can evade detection and input filters, leading to unauthorized access, data breaches, or system compromise. This method can facilitate sophisticated attacks, allowing attackers to execute complex operations, escalate privileges, and manipulate or exfiltrate sensitive information, significantly compromising the security and integrity of the system."
