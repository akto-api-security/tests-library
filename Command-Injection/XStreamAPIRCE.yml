info:
  name: "XStream API Remote Code Execution"
  description: "The XStream API Remote Code Execution vulnerability allows attackers to exploit deserialization flaws in the XStream library. By sending malicious XML input, attackers can trigger arbitrary code execution on the server using the API. This vulnerability affects Java-based applications that rely on XStream for XML processing, potentially leading to unauthorized access and system compromise."
  details: "The XStream API Remote Code Execution vulnerability stems from unsafe deserialization in the XStream library, commonly used in Java applications for converting objects to XML and vice versa. Attackers can craft harmful XML payloads, sneaking in commands that the server unwittingly executes. This flaw can open the door to unauthorized control over the affected server, allowing for malicious actions like data theft or system disruption, making it crucial for developers to apply patches and input validation measures."
  impact: "The impact of the XStream API Remote Code Execution vulnerability is significant, as it allows attackers to gain full control over the targeted system by executing arbitrary code. This can result in unauthorized access, data breaches, or the installation of malware. Since many Java applications use XStream for XML processing, the flaw can compromise critical systems if not properly mitigated."
