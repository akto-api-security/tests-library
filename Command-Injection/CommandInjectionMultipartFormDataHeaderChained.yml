info:
  name: "Command injection in Content-Type headers having Multipart form data value with chained system instructions"
  description: "Command injection in Content-Type headers with multipart form data involves exploiting vulnerabilities in how applications handle HTTP headers and form data. Attackers can inject malicious commands into the Content-Type header or the multipart form data fields, chaining these commands to execute complex instructions. By manipulating the Content-Type and form data, attackers can bypass input validation, execute unauthorized commands, and compromise the system. This technique leverages improper handling of HTTP headers and multipart data to perform sophisticated attacks."
  details: >
    "Command injection in Content-Type headers with multipart form data involves exploiting weaknesses in how an application processes HTTP headers and multipart form submissions. Attackers inject malicious commands into the Content-Type header or the multipart form data fields, using these injections to chain multiple commands. This can include manipulating headers to bypass validation or inject commands into form fields to execute unauthorized instructions. The result is a complex attack that can lead to system compromise, unauthorized data access, or modification."
  impact: "The impact of command injection in Content-Type headers with multipart form data can be significant, as it allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands by exploiting vulnerabilities in header and form data handling. This can lead to unauthorized system access, data breaches, or system modifications by chaining commands through form submissions. The ability to manipulate HTTP headers and multipart data increases the potential for complex attacks, which can compromise the security and integrity of the system and expose sensitive information."
