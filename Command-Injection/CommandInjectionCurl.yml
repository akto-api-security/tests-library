info:
  name: "Command injection for information gathering with HTTP requests with curl"
  description: "Command injection for information gathering with HTTP requests using curl involves attackers injecting malicious commands into a vulnerable input field to execute curl requests. This allows them to fetch and retrieve sensitive data from internal or external servers. By exploiting this vulnerability, attackers can gather valuable information that aids in further compromising the target system."
  details: >
    "Command injection for information gathering using curl involves attackers exploiting input fields in a web application to execute curl commands. These commands can retrieve data from internal or external servers by injecting malicious parameters. This technique helps attackers collect critical information, such as server configurations, internal network details, or sensitive files, which can be used for further attacks or exploitation."
  impact: "The impact of command injection for information gathering with curl can be severe, as it allows attackers to retrieve sensitive data and internal system information. This may lead to the exposure of confidential configurations, internal network structures, or private files. Such information can facilitate further attacks, including data breaches or system compromise, and significantly undermine the security posture of the organization."
