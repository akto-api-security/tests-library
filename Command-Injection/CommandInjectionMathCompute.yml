info:
  name: "Command injection via arithmetic expression execution with echo"
  description: "Command injection via arithmetic expression execution with `echo` involves exploiting an application's handling of arithmetic inputs to execute arbitrary commands. By injecting mathematical expressions into input fields, attackers can manipulate the command line to execute unintended commands, which are then displayed using `echo`. This vulnerability can lead to unauthorized command execution and requires stringent input validation to prevent exploitation."
  details: >
    "Command injection via arithmetic expression execution with `echo` allows attackers to insert malicious arithmetic expressions into input fields. When these expressions are evaluated and the results are displayed using `echo`, it can reveal or execute unintended commands. This occurs because the application improperly processes or sanitizes the input, leading to potential security breaches. Implementing robust input validation and sanitization is essential to mitigate such vulnerabilities."
  impact: "The impact of command injection via arithmetic expression execution with `echo` can be severe, as it allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the system. This can lead to unauthorized access, data exposure, and system compromise. The ability to manipulate or view sensitive information can result in significant security breaches and operational disruptions. Promptly addressing such vulnerabilities is crucial to protecting system integrity and data security."
