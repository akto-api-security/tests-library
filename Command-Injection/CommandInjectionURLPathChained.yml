info:
  name: "Command injection in URL Path with Chained System Instructions"
  description: "Command injection in the URL path with chained system instructions involves exploiting vulnerabilities in how an application processes URL paths. Attackers can inject malicious commands into the URL path, which are then executed in sequence with other system instructions. By chaining these commands, attackers can manipulate system behavior, gain unauthorized access, or compromise the system. This technique takes advantage of improper handling of URL paths to execute complex and potentially harmful operations."
  details: >
    "Command injection in the URL path with chained system instructions exploits vulnerabilities in applications that process URL paths. Attackers inject malicious commands directly into the URL path, which are then executed by the server along with additional chained commands. This allows attackers to perform unauthorized actions, such as accessing sensitive data, executing harmful operations, or modifying system configurations. By chaining commands, attackers can execute complex sequences of instructions, escalating the potential impact of the attack."
  impact: "The impact of command injection in the URL path with chained system instructions can be extensive, as it allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands and potentially compromise the entire system. By injecting and chaining commands through the URL path, attackers can gain unauthorized access, alter system configurations, or exfiltrate sensitive data. This method can lead to severe security breaches, data loss, and disruption of service, posing significant risks to system integrity and confidentiality."
