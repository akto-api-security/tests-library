info:
  name: "Command injection by variable assignment"
  description: "Command injection by variable assignment is a security vulnerability where an attacker manipulates environment variables to execute arbitrary commands. By injecting malicious input into variables used by a system command, the attacker can gain unauthorized access or control over the system. This type of injection exploits insufficient input validation and can lead to severe security breaches if not properly mitigated."
  details: >
    "Command injection by variable assignment occurs when an attacker exploits a vulnerability in how a program assigns values to environment variables. By injecting malicious commands into these variables, the attacker can manipulate the system to execute unintended commands. This often happens due to improper input validation or sanitization, allowing unauthorized command execution and potentially compromising system security. Properly validating and sanitizing user input can prevent this type of attack."
  impact: "The impact of command injection by variable assignment can be severe, leading to unauthorized command execution and system compromise. Attackers may gain access to sensitive data, modify system configurations, or disrupt operations. This can result in data breaches, financial losses, and damage to an organization's reputation. Ensuring robust input validation and sanitization is crucial to mitigate such risks."
