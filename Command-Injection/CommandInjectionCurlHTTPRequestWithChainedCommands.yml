  name: "Command injection for information gathering with HTTP requests with curl and chained system commands"
  description: "Command injection for information gathering using HTTP requests with `curl` and chained system commands involves exploiting vulnerabilities to execute commands that collect system or network data. Attackers can use `curl` to send HTTP requests and chain these commands with additional system commands to extract valuable information or interact with web services. By combining HTTP requests with command injection, attackers can gather detailed system or application data, perform reconnaissance, and potentially expose sensitive information or system configurations."

    "Command injection for information gathering with HTTP requests and `curl` involves exploiting vulnerabilities to send HTTP requests and execute additional commands to collect information. Attackers might use `curl` to query web services and chain these requests with commands that extract system details or manipulate outputs. For example, they could use `curl` to fetch data from a remote service and then chain commands to parse or analyze this data, revealing sensitive information about the system or application configuration. This technique facilitates comprehensive reconnaissance and data collection."
  impact: "The impact of command injection for information gathering with HTTP requests and `curl` can be considerable, as it allows attackers to extract sensitive system or application data through combined HTTP requests and system commands. By leveraging this technique, attackers can obtain detailed information about the target's environment, configuration, or vulnerabilities, which can be used for further exploitation. This can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and a comprehensive understanding of the target system, increasing the risk of successful attacks and security compromises."
