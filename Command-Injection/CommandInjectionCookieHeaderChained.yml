info:
  name: "Command injection in Cookie Header with Chained system instructions"
  description: "Command injection in the Cookie header with chained system instructions involves exploiting vulnerabilities in an application that processes HTTP headers, particularly cookies. Attackers can inject malicious commands into the Cookie header, which are then executed in conjunction with other system instructions. By chaining these commands, attackers can execute complex sequences of operations, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data manipulation, or system compromise. This method leverages improper handling of HTTP headers to exploit security weaknesses in the application."
  details: >
    "Command injection in the Cookie header with chained system instructions involves injecting malicious commands into the Cookie header of an HTTP request, which the server processes and executes. Attackers can include payloads in the Cookie that chain commands together, leveraging vulnerabilities in the server’s handling of HTTP headers. This can lead to the execution of unauthorized system instructions, such as accessing sensitive data or modifying system configurations, thereby compromising the security and integrity of the server or application."
  impact: "The impact of command injection in the Cookie header with chained system instructions can be severe, as it allows attackers to execute malicious commands by exploiting vulnerabilities in HTTP header processing. This can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, or system modifications by executing harmful instructions embedded in the Cookie. The ability to chain commands amplifies the risk, potentially enabling complex attacks that compromise system security, escalate privileges, and expose sensitive information."
