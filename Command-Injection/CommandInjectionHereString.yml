id: COMMAND_INJECTION_WITH_HERE_STRING
info:
  name: "Command injection by using Here String"
  description: "Command injection by using a here string involves exploiting vulnerabilities by injecting malicious input into a command that uses the `<<<` operator. This operator provides a single-line string as input to a command, which can be manipulated to execute unintended commands. If an application improperly processes such inputs, attackers can leverage here strings to bypass security controls and execute arbitrary commands. Proper input validation and handling are essential to mitigate these risks."
  details: >
    "Command injection via here strings involves injecting malicious content into commands that use the `<<<` operator to provide single-line input. Attackers exploit this by crafting inputs that can alter command execution or introduce harmful commands. If user inputs are not properly sanitized, these injected strings can execute unintended operations or bypass security mechanisms. Effective input validation and secure command handling are crucial to prevent such vulnerabilities."
  impact: "The impact of command injection via here strings can be significant, as it allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands by injecting malicious input. This can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, or system compromise. The ability to manipulate command input can disrupt system operations and expose sensitive information, highlighting the importance of rigorous input validation and secure command handling to prevent such exploits."
