  name: "Command injection by using Here String and Chained system commands"
  description: "Command injection using Here Strings and chained system commands involves exploiting vulnerabilities to inject commands into an application using Here Strings, a feature in some shells for providing input directly to commands. Attackers leverage Here Strings (`<<<`) to supply data or command sequences, combining them with chained commands to execute complex operations. This technique allows attackers to bypass input validation, execute multiple commands in sequence, and manipulate or exfiltrate data, increasing the potential for unauthorized access and system compromise."
  details: >
    "Command injection using Here Strings and chained system commands takes advantage of shell features that allow attackers to input data directly into commands. By using Here Strings (`<<<`), attackers can inject malicious input or commands, which are then processed along with other chained commands. This approach enables attackers to execute multiple commands in sequence, often bypassing input validation and security filters. The ability to manipulate inputs and chain commands increases the potential for executing harmful operations, accessing or altering sensitive data, and compromising system integrity."
  impact: "The impact of command injection using Here Strings and chained commands can be severe, as it enables attackers to inject and execute arbitrary commands in a targeted system. This can lead to unauthorized access, data manipulation, or system compromise by allowing attackers to perform complex operations in sequence. The use of Here Strings can bypass input validation, making it easier to exploit vulnerabilities and execute harmful commands that might modify system files, exfiltrate sensitive data, or escalate privileges, significantly jeopardizing system security and stability."
