  name: "Authentication Bypass with replaying Password Change Endpoint"
  description: >
    "Authentication Bypass via Password Change Endpoint Replay is a security vulnerability  where attackers replay previously intercepted password change requests to gain
    unauthorized access. By exploiting this weakness, malicious actors can circumvent  authentication controls and compromise user accounts without the need for valid  credentials. This underscores the importance of implementing robust security  measures to prevent and detect replay attacks in password change processes,  enhancing overall system resilience against unauthorized access attempts."
  details: >
    "Authentication Bypass via Password Change Endpoint Replay is a security threat  where attackers intercept and replay previously captured password change requests.  By exploiting this vulnerability, malicious actors can bypass authentication  controls and gain unauthorized access to user accounts without valid credentials.  This underscores the importance of implementing secure and dynamic mechanisms in  password change processes to prevent replay attacks, enhancing overall system security."
  impact: >
    "The impact of Authentication Bypass via Password Change Endpoint Replay is severe,  as it allows attackers to gain unauthorized access to user accounts without the  need for valid credentials. This exploitation can lead to unauthorized data access,  manipulation, or even account takeover. Organizations may suffer compromised user  privacy, data breaches, and reputational damage if robust security measures are not  in place to detect and prevent such replay attacks in password change processes."
