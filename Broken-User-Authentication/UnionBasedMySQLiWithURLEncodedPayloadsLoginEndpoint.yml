  name: "Union based SQL Injection test with URL Encoded Payloads for MySQL on Login Endpoints"
  description: > 
    "A Union-based SQL Injection test with URL-encoded payloads for MySQL on login endpoints involves encoding SQL injection strings to bypass web application firewalls and input validation mechanisms. By using URL encoding, testers can conceal malicious queries that include UNION SELECT statements within login input fields. This technique aims to manipulate SQL queries and retrieve sensitive data from the database, exploiting vulnerabilities in how the application processes encoded input."
  details: >
    "In Union-based SQL Injection tests with URL-encoded payloads for MySQL on login endpoints, attackers encode their SQL injection strings to evade web application firewalls and input validation filters. By URL-encoding the payload, they obscure malicious UNION SELECT statements within login inputs, making it harder for security mechanisms to detect the attack. This method allows attackers to exploit SQL query vulnerabilities, potentially extracting sensitive data from the database while bypassing standard security checks."
  impact: >
    "The impact of Union-based SQL Injection with URL-encoded payloads for MySQL on login endpoints can be substantial, allowing attackers to bypass security mechanisms and retrieve sensitive database information. Successful exploitation can lead to unauthorized access to user accounts, exposure of confidential data, and manipulation of database content. Such breaches can cause significant reputational damage, financial losses, and potential legal consequences for the affected organization."
