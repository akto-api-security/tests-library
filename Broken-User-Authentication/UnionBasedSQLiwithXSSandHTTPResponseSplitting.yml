  name: "Union based SQL Injection Test with XSS and HTTP Response Splitting"
  description: > 
    "Union-based SQL Injection Test involves using the UNION operator to retrieve additional data by merging queries. When combined with XSS, it injects malicious scripts into web pages, potentially leading to data theft or session hijacking. HTTP Response Splitting manipulates server responses to create multiple responses from a single request, enhancing the attack's complexity. This approach tests various vulnerabilities for a comprehensive security assessment."
  details: >
    "Union-based SQL Injection Test exploits SQL vulnerabilities using the UNION operator to retrieve additional data from the database. Combining this with XSS allows the injection of malicious scripts into web pages, potentially stealing data or hijacking sessions. HTTP Response Splitting manipulates server responses to create multiple responses from a single request, increasing the attack's complexity and impact. This method tests multiple vulnerabilities for a thorough security evaluation."
  impact: >
    "Union-based SQL Injection, combined with XSS and HTTP Response Splitting, can have severe impacts including unauthorized data access, data theft, and compromised user accounts. These attacks can inject malicious scripts into web pages, leading to session hijacking and further exploitation. The manipulation of server responses can disrupt web application functionality and security, making these combined attacks particularly dangerous for both users and web administrators."
