  name: "Union based SQL Injection test with Credit Card Data Extraction Payload for PostgreSQL"
  description: >
    "A Union-based SQL Injection test with credit card data extraction payload for PostgreSQL involves injecting SQL queries designed to retrieve credit card information from the database. By using UNION SELECT statements, testers can combine results from malicious queries with legitimate ones, targeting tables that store credit card data. This method exploits vulnerabilities in input validation and query execution to access sensitive financial information."
  details: >
    "In a Union-based SQL Injection test with credit card data extraction payload for PostgreSQL, testers inject UNION SELECT statements to retrieve credit card information stored in the database. This involves crafting SQL queries that target specific tables and columns where credit card data is likely stored. By exploiting vulnerabilities in input validation and query handling, attackers can extract sensitive financial information, such as credit card numbers, expiration dates, and cardholder names."
  impact: >
    "The impact of Union-based SQL Injection with credit card data extraction payload for PostgreSQL can be devastating. Successful exploitation can lead to unauthorized access to and theft of credit card information, resulting in financial fraud and identity theft. This can cause severe financial losses for affected individuals and organizations, along with legal liabilities and significant damage to the organization's reputation."
