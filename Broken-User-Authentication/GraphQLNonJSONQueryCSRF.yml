info:
  name: "CSRF test with Non-JSON Queries in HTTP GET Query Parameters in GraphQL"
  description: "A CSRF test with Non-JSON Queries in HTTP GET Query Parameters in GraphQL involves examining whether the GraphQL endpoint is susceptible to Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks when queries are passed as non-JSON parameters in the URL of an HTTP GET request. Testers manipulate the query parameters to assess if the server properly validates and protects against unauthorized requests. This test helps ensure the security of the GraphQL API by identifying and mitigating potential vulnerabilities related to CSRF attacks."
  details: "In a CSRF test with Non-JSON Queries in HTTP GET Query Parameters in GraphQL, testers craft GraphQL queries and pass them as parameters in the URL of an HTTP GET request. This method simulates an attack where malicious actors manipulate query parameters to exploit vulnerabilities. The test aims to determine if the GraphQL endpoint adequately validates and defends against unauthorized requests, safeguarding against CSRF attacks."
  impact: "If a CSRF test with Non-JSON Queries in HTTP GET Query Parameters in GraphQL reveals vulnerabilities, attackers could exploit them to execute unauthorized actions on behalf of users, such as modifying data or performing sensitive operations. This could lead to data breaches, unauthorized access, or even complete compromise of the system. The impact may include reputational damage, loss of trust, and potential legal repercussions for the organization."
