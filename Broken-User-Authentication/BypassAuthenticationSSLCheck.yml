  name: "Bypass Authentication by modifying URL to HTTP only"
  description: > 
    "Bypassing authentication by modifying the URL to HTTP is a security exploit where 
    attackers manipulate the URL protocol, often downgrading from HTTPS to HTTP. This 
    manipulation can compromise the integrity of secure authentication processes, 
    enabling unauthorized access to sensitive systems. Preventive measures include
    enforcing HTTPS, implementing secure session management, and conducting regular 
    security assessments to identify and mitigate such vulnerabilities."
  details: >
    "Bypassing authentication by modifying the URL to HTTP is a security vulnerability 
    where attackers manipulate the web address, often downgrading from HTTPS to HTTP. 
    This manipulation can compromise secure authentication, allowing unauthorized 
    access to sensitive systems. Mitigation involves enforcing HTTPS, implementing 
    robust session management, and conducting regular security audits to detect and 
    remediate such vulnerabilities."
  impact: >
    "The impact of bypassing authentication by modifying the URL to HTTP can be severe, 
    potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive information or systems. 
    This manipulation compromises the confidentiality and integrity of data exchanged 
    during authentication. Organizations may face reputational damage, regulatory 
    consequences, and compromised user trust. Mitigating this risk requires strict 
    enforcement of HTTPS, secure session handling, and continuous monitoring for 
    potential vulnerabilities."
