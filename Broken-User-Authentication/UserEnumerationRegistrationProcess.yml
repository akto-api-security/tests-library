  name: "Broken Authentication Test - Username Enumeration via Registration Endpoint"
  description: > 
    "In this scenario, security testing assesses a system's authentication by attempting user 
    registration with valid and invalid usernames. Testers analyze responses to detect patterns 
    that may reveal the existence of valid usernames, aiming to uncover vulnerabilities in the 
    registration process. This evaluation strengthens overall authentication security and 
    mitigates the risk of unauthorized access."
  details: >
    "This test assesses a system by attempting user registrations with different usernames. 
    Testers analyze responses to identify patterns that may reveal valid usernames, addressing 
    vulnerabilities in the registration process to enhance overall authentication security 
    and prevent potential unauthorized access."
  impact: >
    "The impact of a successful Broken Authentication Test - Username Enumeration via Registration 
    Endpoint is significant. It may lead to the inadvertent disclosure of valid usernames, enabling 
    targeted attacks for unauthorized access. This vulnerability poses a risk of compromised user 
    accounts, potential data breaches, and increased security threats. Swift mitigation is crucial 
    to fortify authentication security and prevent unauthorized access."
