  name: "Authentication Bypass using API replay with no CSRF/XSRF tokens"
  description: >
    "If replaying a request with a user-agent identified as a browser and lacking  'csrf' or 'xsrf' headers successfully authenticates the API, it indicates a potential  broken authentication vulnerability. This scenario suggests that the absence of  anti-CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection allows for unauthorized replay  of authenticated requests, potentially leading to account compromise or  unauthorized access. Addressing this vulnerability involves implementing  proper CSRF protections to fortify authentication mechanisms and prevent exploitation  through unauthorized replay attacks"
  details: >
    "Replaying a request without 'csrf' or 'xsrf' headers, and successful API authentication  when the user-agent is a browser, signals a potential broken authentication  vulnerability. In this context, the absence of anti-CSRF protection could allow  unauthorized replay attacks, jeopardizing the integrity of user accounts and  access controls. Mitigating this vulnerability requires implementing robust  anti-CSRF measures to bolster authentication security and prevent unauthorized  request replays."
  impact: >
    "The impact of successfully replaying a request without 'csrf' or 'xsrf' headers in a  browser's user-agent, leading to authenticated API access, signifies a critical  broken authentication vulnerability. This vulnerability could enable malicious  actors to perform unauthorized actions, compromise user accounts, and potentially  gain control over sensitive information. Implementing effective anti-CSRF protections  is imperative to mitigate this risk, ensuring the resilience of authentication  mechanisms and safeguarding against unauthorized replay attacks."
