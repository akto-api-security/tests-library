info:
  name: "Authentication Bypass by sending multiple credentials in parameters"
  description: >
    "Authentication Bypass by sending multiple credentials in parameters is a security  vulnerability where attackers attempt to exploit authentication systems by submitting  multiple sets of credentials simultaneously. By manipulating parameters, such as  username and password, attackers aim to circumvent authentication controls and  gain unauthorized access. This method underscores the importance of input validation  and secure authentication processes to prevent such credential-based attacks,  fortifying the overall security of the system against unauthorized entry."
  details: >
    "Authentication Bypass by sending multiple credentials in parameters is a security  risk where attackers manipulate authentication mechanisms by submitting various  sets of credentials concurrently. By altering parameters, such as username and  password, adversaries attempt to evade authentication controls, leading to potential  unauthorized access. Effective input validation and robust authentication protocols  are essential countermeasures to thwart such attacks, ensuring the integrity of  user authentication processes and bolstering overall system security."
  impact: >
    "The impact of Authentication Bypass by sending multiple credentials in parameters  is significant, as it can lead to unauthorized access and potential compromise of  user accounts. Exploiting this vulnerability may allow attackers to circumvent  authentication controls, posing a risk to the confidentiality and integrity of  sensitive information. Implementing stringent input validation checks and adopting  secure authentication practices is crucial to mitigate this threat, safeguard user  credentials, and maintain the overall security of the system."
