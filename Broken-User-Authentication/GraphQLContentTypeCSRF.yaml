info:
  name: "CSRF test with Content-Type header in GraphQL"
  description: "CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) test with a manipulated Content-Type header in GraphQL involves assessing the vulnerability of a GraphQL endpoint to unauthorized requests. By tampering with the Content-Type header, attackers may attempt to bypass CSRF protection mechanisms, potentially enabling them to execute malicious actions on behalf of authenticated users. This test aims to evaluate the security measures in place and ensure the GraphQL API is resilient against such attacks."
  details: "In this CSRF test, we manipulate the Content-Type header to test if the GraphQL endpoint is vulnerable to unauthorized requests. By sending GraphQL queries with altered headers, they assess whether the server is properly protected against Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks. This test helps ensure the security of the GraphQL API by identifying and fixing potential vulnerabilities."
  impact: "If this CSRF test with Content-Type header manipulation in GraphQL reveals vulnerabilities, it could lead to serious consequences such as unauthorized access to sensitive data or actions on behalf of authenticated users. Attackers may exploit these weaknesses to perform actions like modifying user data, executing fraudulent transactions, or even taking over user accounts. This could result in financial loss, reputational damage, and legal implications for the affected organization."
