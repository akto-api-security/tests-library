info:
  name: "Authentication Bypass by using LDAP payloads for Login endpoints"
  description: >
    "Authentication Bypass via LDAP payloads manipulates login endpoints in web  applications. Attackers exploit vulnerabilities by injecting specially crafted  Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) payloads, deceiving the  authentication process. This allows unauthorized access by tricking the  system into validating incorrect or manipulated credentials, emphasizing  the importance of secure coding practices and robust input validation mechanisms."
  details: >
    "Authentication Bypass using LDAP payloads is a technique where attackers  exploit vulnerabilities in web application login endpoints. By injecting  specially crafted LDAP payloads, they manipulate the authentication process  to grant unauthorized access. This method targets weaknesses in input  validation, allowing adversaries to trick the system into validating incorrect  credentials and gain illicit entry. Prevention involves implementing strong  input validation and secure coding practices."
  impact: >
    "Authentication Bypass through LDAP payloads can have severe consequences,  enabling unauthorized access to sensitive systems. Attackers can exploit  this vulnerability to compromise user accounts, access confidential data,  and potentially execute unauthorized actions within the application. The  impact extends to reputational damage, financial loss, and regulatory  consequences, underscoring the critical need for robust security measures to  prevent such exploits."
