  name: "User Enumeration using Directory Access"
  description: > 
    "User Enumeration using Directory Access entails examining HTTP responses when 
    accessing directory paths with invalid and valid user credentials. For instance, 
    an attempt with an invalid user may yield a 403 (Forbidden) response, while a 
    valid user could result in a 404 (Not Found) response. This analysis aids in 
    identifying and addressing potential security risks related to unauthorized 
    user enumeration, enhancing the overall security posture of web applications."
  details: >
    "User Enumeration using Directory Access involves scrutinizing HTTP responses when 
    accessing directory paths with different user credentials. For instance, an attempt 
    with an invalid user might trigger a 403 (Forbidden) response, whereas a valid user 
    could elicit a 404 (Not Found) response. This examination helps identify potential 
    security vulnerabilities tied to unauthorized user enumeration, contributing to 
    improved web application security."
  impact: >
    "The impact of User Enumeration using Directory Access lies in its potential to expose 
    security vulnerabilities within web applications. By discerning distinct HTTP responses 
    for invalid and valid user credentials, attackers can gain insights into valid usernames, 
    facilitating targeted exploits. This form of enumeration poses a threat to 
    confidentiality and can lead to unauthorized access, making it crucial for organizations 
    to address and remediate such vulnerabilities to safeguard their systems and user data."
