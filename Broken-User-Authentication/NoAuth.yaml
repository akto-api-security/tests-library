info:
  name: "Broken Authentication by removing auth token"
  description: "API don't validate the authenticity of token. Attacker can remove the auth token and access the endpoint."
  details: >
            "The endpoint appears to be vulnerable to broken authentication attack. The original request was replayed by removing victim's <b>auth</b> token. The server responded with 2XX success codes.<br>"
            "<b>Background:</b> Authentication is the process of attempting to verify the digital identity of the sender of a communication. Testing the authentication schema means understanding how the authentication process works and using that information to
            circumvent the authentication mechanism. While most applications require authentication to gain access to private information or to execute tasks, not every authentication method is able to provide adequate security. Negligence, ignorance, or simple
            understatement of security threats often result in authentication schemes that can be bypassed by simply skipping the log in page and directly calling an internal page that is supposed to be accessed only after authentication has been performed."
  impact: "Broken User authentication is a serious vulnerability. Attackers can gain control to other usersâ€™ accounts in the system, read their personal data, and perform sensitive actions on their behalf, like money transactions and sending personal messages."
  remediation: "To mitigate the risk of Broken Authentication by removing auth token, implement proper session management techniques. Use secure cookies with HTTPOnly and Secure flags to store session tokens, preventing client-side manipulation. Additionally, enforce re-authentication for sensitive actions and regularly rotate session tokens to reduce the risk of token theft. Implement multi-factor authentication for an added layer of security. Regularly audit session management mechanisms to ensure they remain robust against potential attacks."
