info:
  name: "Authentication Bypass with Blank Password"
  description: > 
    "Authentication Bypass with Blank Password is a security vulnerability where attackers 
    gain unauthorized access by submitting an empty password during authentication. Exploiting 
    this weakness circumvents password-based security, risking unauthorized control of 
    sensitive data or systems. Prevention involves enforcing strong, non-empty passwords 
    and implementing rigorous input validation in authentication systems."
  details: >
    "Authentication Bypass with Blank Password is a security vulnerability where attackers 
    exploit systems that allow login with an empty password field. By submitting no password, 
    unauthorized access may be granted, potentially compromising sensitive data or system 
    controls. To mitigate this risk, it's crucial to implement strict password policies, 
    disallowing blank passwords, and conduct regular security audits to ensure the robustness 
    of authentication mechanisms."
  impact: >
    "The impact of Authentication Bypass with Blank Password can be significant, leading to 
    unauthorized access and potential compromise of sensitive information or systems. 
    Attackers exploiting this vulnerability may gain unfettered control, posing risks 
    to data confidentiality and system integrity. Organizations face reputational damage, 
    financial losses, and regulatory consequences. Mitigation involves enforcing stringent 
    password policies and promptly addressing and fixing such vulnerabilities through 
    thorough security measures."
