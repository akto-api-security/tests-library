id: AUTH_BYPASS_BLANK_PASSWORD
info:
  name: "Authentication Bypass with Blank Password"
  description: >
    "Authentication Bypass with Blank Password is a security vulnerability where attackers  gain unauthorized access by submitting an empty password during authentication. Exploiting  this weakness circumvents password-based security, risking unauthorized control of  sensitive data or systems. Prevention involves enforcing strong, non-empty passwords  and implementing rigorous input validation in authentication systems."
  details: >
    "Authentication Bypass with Blank Password is a security vulnerability where attackers  exploit systems that allow login with an empty password field. By submitting no password,  unauthorized access may be granted, potentially compromising sensitive data or system  controls. To mitigate this risk, it's crucial to implement strict password policies,  disallowing blank passwords, and conduct regular security audits to ensure the robustness  of authentication mechanisms."
  impact: >
    "The impact of Authentication Bypass with Blank Password can be significant, leading to  unauthorized access and potential compromise of sensitive information or systems.  Attackers exploiting this vulnerability may gain unfettered control, posing risks  to data confidentiality and system integrity. Organizations face reputational damage,  financial losses, and regulatory consequences. Mitigation involves enforcing stringent  password policies and promptly addressing and fixing such vulnerabilities through  thorough security measures."
