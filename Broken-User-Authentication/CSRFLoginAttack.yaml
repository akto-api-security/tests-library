info:
  name: "CSRF Login attack"
  description: "Hackers trick users to log into their account by forging requests, exploiting server authentication."
  details: >
            "A login CSRF attack involves hackers tricking users into logging into an attacker-controlled account."
            "By forging a request using their credentials and submitting it to the victim's browser, the server mistakenly authenticates the request, granting access to the attacker's account."
  impact: >
    "Depending on the user account and information exposed, the impacts of an attack range from mild to severe."
    "Some consequences of a successful login CSRF attack include: Deployment of malicious code, Unauthorized financial transactions and Data breach and sensitive information exposure"
  remediation: "To mitigate login CSRF attacks, implement anti-CSRF tokens in login forms. These tokens should be unique for each user session and validated upon submission. Additionally, ensure that sensitive actions, such as login requests, require reauthentication or use multi-step verification processes. Regularly educate users about the risks of phishing attacks and encourage them to verify the authenticity of login pages before entering their credentials."
