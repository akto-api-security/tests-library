  name: "Advanced Union based SQL Injection test on Login Endpoints"
  description: >
    "An advanced Union-based SQL Injection test on login endpoints involves using complex SQL queries with the UNION operator to merge results from multiple queries, often employing subqueries and database functions. This sophisticated approach aims to bypass security mechanisms and extract specific data from deep within the database. It requires a thorough understanding of the database schema and can reveal intricate vulnerabilities not detected by basic tests."
  details: >
    "Advanced Union-based SQL Injection testing on login endpoints involves crafting complex SQL queries using the UNION operator, often including subqueries and advanced database functions. This approach targets bypassing sophisticated security mechanisms and extracting detailed information from various database tables. Testers need a deep understanding of the database schema and potential entry points to effectively perform these tests, making it a more comprehensive and targeted method for uncovering vulnerabilities."
  impact: >
    "The impact of advanced Union-based SQL Injection on login endpoints can be extremely severe, potentially leading to the exposure of highly sensitive data across multiple database tables. Attackers can gain unauthorized access to critical system information, manipulate or delete data, and compromise the entire database. This advanced attack can result in extensive data breaches, significant financial loss, and substantial damage to an organization's credibility and security infrastructure."
