  name: "Time based SQL injection test for MySQL DB for GET method APIs"
  description: "The Time-Based SQL Injection Test for MySQL DB for GET Method APIs involves injecting malicious SQL queries into GET request parameters with the goal of exploiting time delays in the database response. By crafting queries that intentionally cause time delays, attackers can infer the presence of a vulnerability based on the response time. This technique helps identify blind SQL injection vulnerabilities, where direct error messages are not returned, but the server’s response time can reveal valuable information about the database structure or the presence of SQL injection flaws. Proper input sanitization and the use of prepared statements are essential to prevent this type of attack."
  details: "The Time-Based SQL Injection Test for MySQL DB for GET Method APIs targets blind SQL injection vulnerabilities where no direct error messages are returned, but the database response time can be manipulated. Attackers inject SQL queries with specific delays, such as `SLEEP()` or `BENCHMARK()`, to cause the server to wait for a set amount of time before responding. By measuring the delay, the attacker can infer information about the database or application logic, allowing them to craft more targeted attacks. This method is useful for identifying vulnerabilities in scenarios where traditional SQL injection testing is ineffective due to lack of visible error feedback."
  impact: "The impact of the Time-Based SQL Injection Test for MySQL DB for GET Method APIs can be severe, as it allows attackers to extract sensitive database information without triggering visible errors. By leveraging response time delays, attackers can infer database structure, access control mechanisms, or sensitive data. This can lead to unauthorized access, data leakage, or further exploitation. Without proper defenses, such as input validation and the use of parameterized queries, this vulnerability can expose critical system flaws and result in significant security breaches."
