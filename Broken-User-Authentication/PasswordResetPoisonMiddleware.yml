  name: "Password Reset Endpoint Poisoning via Middleware"
  description: > 
    "Password reset poisoning via middleware is a security risk where attackers manipulate 
    middleware components during the password reset process. By injecting malicious code 
    or intercepting and modifying reset requests, attackers compromise the reset mechanism, 
    potentially leading to unauthorized access and account compromise. Securing middleware 
    components is crucial to prevent such exploits and maintain the integrity of password 
    reset functionalities in web applications."

    "Password reset poisoning via middleware is a security vulnerability where attackers 
    manipulate middleware components during the password reset process, potentially 
    injecting malicious code or intercepting and modifying reset requests. This 
    compromise can lead to unauthorized access and account compromise, highlighting 
    the need to secure middleware to ensure the integrity of password reset functionalities

  impact: >
    "The impact of password reset poisoning via middleware can be severe, as it allows 
    attackers to compromise the password reset process, leading to unauthorized access and 
    potential account hijacking. By manipulating middleware components, malicious actors 
    may inject malicious code, posing a risk of broader system vulnerabilities and data 
    breaches. Addressing and mitigating this vulnerability promptly is crucial to 
    prevent unauthorized access and uphold the overall security of web applications."
