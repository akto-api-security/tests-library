  name: "Authentication Bypass using JWT Header Param Injection with JWK"
  description: > 
    "Authentication Bypass using JWT Header Param Injection with JWK is a security 
    exploit where attackers manipulate JSON Web Token (JWT) headers, injecting 
    malicious content. By compromising or introducing a rogue JSON Web Key (JWK), 
    the attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in the authentication process, 
    potentially gaining unauthorized access. Proper validation of JWT signatures 
    and safeguarding JSON Web Keys is essential to mitigate the risk of such exploits."
  details: >
    "Authentication Bypass using JWT Header Param Injection with JWK is a security 
    vulnerability where attackers manipulate JSON Web Token (JWT) headers, inserting 
    malicious data. Exploiting this flaw, especially with a compromised JSON Web Key 
    (JWK), allows unauthorized access by tricking the authentication system. 
    Mitigation involves strict validation of JWT signatures and securing JSON 
    Web Keys to prevent such exploitation."
  impact: >
    "The impact of Authentication Bypass using JWT Header Param Injection with JWK 
    can be severe, leading to unauthorized access and potential compromise of 
    sensitive information. Exploiting this vulnerability allows attackers to 
    impersonate legitimate users, bypassing authentication mechanisms. The 
    compromised security may result in unauthorized data access, system 
    manipulation, and potential privacy breaches, underscoring the critical 
    importance of promptly addressing and patching such vulnerabilities."
