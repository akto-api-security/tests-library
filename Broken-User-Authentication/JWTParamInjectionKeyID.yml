info:
  name: "Authentication Bypass using JWT Header Param Injection with Key ID"
  description: > 
    "Authentication Bypass using JWT Header Param Injection with Key ID is a security 
    vulnerability where attackers manipulate the Key ID (kid) in JSON Web Token 
    (JWT) headers to compromise authentication. By injecting malicious content 
    and manipulating the Key ID, attackers can exploit weaknesses in signature 
    verification, potentially leading to unauthorized access. Prevention involves 
    thorough validation of JWT signatures, secure Key ID management, and adherence 
    to best practices for robust authentication security."
  details: >
    "In Authentication Bypass using JWT Header Param Injection with Key ID, attackers 
    manipulate the Key ID (kid) within JSON Web Token (JWT) headers to compromise 
    the authentication process. This manipulation exploits vulnerabilities in 
    signature verification, potentially granting unauthorized access to systems 
    or resources. Mitigation strategies include stringent validation of JWT 
    signatures, careful Key ID management, and the implementation of security 
    measures to prevent exploitation of this specific authentication bypass technique."
  impact: >
    "The impact of Authentication Bypass using JWT Header Param Injection with Key 
    ID can be significant, leading to unauthorized access and potential compromise 
    of sensitive information. Exploiting this vulnerability allows attackers 
    to manipulate authentication processes, potentially gaining control over 
    systems or accounts. The consequence may include unauthorized data access, 
    privacy breaches, and a compromised security posture, emphasizing the 
    critical need for thorough security measures and vigilant monitoring to 
    detect and prevent such attacks."
