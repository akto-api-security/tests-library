  name: "Broken Authentication Test - Username Enumeration on Captcha Endpoint"
  description: > 
    "This test assesses a system's security by probing the authentication process. 
    Testers attempt to exploit vulnerabilities by submitting authentication requests 
    with valid and invalid usernames at the Captcha endpoint. The goal is to evaluate 
    the effectiveness of the Captcha mechanism in preventing user enumeration and 
    enhancing overall authentication security."
  details: >
    "This test focuses on evaluating a system's resilience against username enumeration attacks. 
    Testers attempt to exploit potential vulnerabilities by submitting authentication requests 
    with valid and invalid usernames specifically at the Captcha endpoint. This targeted 
    assessment aims to determine the effectiveness of the Captcha mechanism in thwarting 
    automated enumeration attempts, ensuring robust authentication security."
  impact: >
    "A successful Broken Authentication Test - Username Enumeration on Captcha Endpoint can 
    have severe consequences. By circumventing the Captcha mechanism, attackers may exploit 
    username enumeration to gain unauthorized access. This could lead to compromised user 
    accounts, unauthorized data access, and potential security breaches. Addressing such 
    vulnerabilities is critical for safeguarding user privacy and maintaining the integrity 
    of the authentication process."
