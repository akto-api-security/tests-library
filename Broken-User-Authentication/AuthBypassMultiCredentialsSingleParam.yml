info:
  name: "Authentication Bypass by sending multiple credentials in a single parameter"
  description: >
    "Authentication Bypass by sending multiple credentials in a single parameter is a  security loophole where attackers manipulate authentication systems by combining  various sets of credentials within a unified parameter. This method seeks to  undermine authentication controls, potentially enabling unauthorized access.  Mitigating this vulnerability requires robust input validation and adherence  to secure authentication practices, crucial for preserving the integrity  of user authentication processes and enhancing overall system security."
  details: >
    "Authentication Bypass by sending multiple credentials in a single parameter is a  security risk where attackers attempt to manipulate authentication systems by  consolidating various sets of credentials within a unified parameter. This tactic  aims to subvert authentication controls and gain unauthorized access. Implementing  robust input validation and adopting secure authentication practices are critical  measures to mitigate this vulnerability, fortifying the integrity of user  authentication processes and enhancing overall system security."
  impact: >
    "The impact of Authentication Bypass by sending multiple credentials in a single  parameter is significant, as it can lead to unauthorized access and potential  compromise of user accounts. This vulnerability allows attackers to subvert  authentication controls, posing a risk to the confidentiality and integrity  of sensitive information. Implementing strict input validation and reinforcing  secure authentication practices is essential to mitigate this threat, safeguard  user credentials, and uphold the overall security of the system."
