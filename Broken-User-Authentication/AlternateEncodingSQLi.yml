  name: "SQL Injection test using Alternate Encoding"
  description: >
    "SQL injection using alternate encoding involves exploiting vulnerabilities by bypassing input filters and security mechanisms that traditionally block or sanitize SQL injection attempts. Attackers use encoding techniques such as UTF-8, Unicode, or other character sets to evade detection and inject malicious SQL queries into vulnerable applications. This method aims to deceive input validation checks and execute unauthorized SQL commands, potentially compromising the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the database and the application."
  details: >
    "SQL injection using alternate encoding is a technique where attackers manipulate input data using different character encodings (e.g., UTF-8, Unicode) to evade detection by security filters. By encoding special characters, attackers bypass input validation mechanisms and inject malicious SQL queries into vulnerable applications. This method aims to exploit weaknesses in how input data is processed, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data leakage, or database manipulation."
  impact: >
    "The impact of SQL injection using alternate encoding can be significant, allowing attackers to bypass security measures and execute unauthorized SQL commands. This can lead to data breaches, unauthorized access to sensitive information, and manipulation or deletion of critical data within the database. Additionally, such attacks can compromise the integrity and availability of the application and its associated services, posing serious risks to the organization's operations and reputation."
