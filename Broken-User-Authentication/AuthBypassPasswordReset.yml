  name: "Authentication Bypass with replaying Password Reset Endpoint"
  description: > 
    "Authentication Bypass via Password Reset Endpoint Replay is a security vulnerability 
    where attackers intercept and replay previously captured password reset requests. 
    Exploiting this flaw enables unauthorized access to user accounts without valid 
    credentials. This underscores the importance of implementing robust security 
    measures to prevent and detect replay attacks in password reset processes, crucial 
    for maintaining overall system security."
  details: >
    "Authentication Bypass via Password Reset Endpoint Replay is a security vulnerability 
    where attackers intercept and replay captured password reset requests, enabling 
    unauthorized access to user accounts without valid credentials. This exploitation 
    poses a significant threat to system security, emphasizing the need for robust 
    measures in password reset processes to detect and prevent replay attacks effectively. 
    Implementing dynamic and secure authentication controls is crucial for safeguarding 
    user accounts and maintaining overall system integrity."
  impact: >
    "The impact of Authentication Bypass via Password Reset Endpoint Replay is profound, 
    as it allows malicious actors to gain unauthorized access to user accounts without 
    valid credentials. This exploitation can lead to compromised user privacy, 
    unauthorized data access, and potential account takeovers. Organizations may 
    face severe consequences, including reputational damage and regulatory issues, 
    highlighting the critical importance of implementing stringent security measures 
    to thwart replay attacks in password reset processes."
