  name: "Log4j vulnerability test on HTTP request headers"
  description: >
    "This involves assessing if a system is susceptible to the Log4j (CVE-2021-44228) exploit by injecting malicious payloads into HTTP headers. This test checks if the server is logging the headers without sanitization, potentially triggering a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability. The test simulates real-world attack scenarios where attackers exploit unprotected logging functions in web applications."
  details: >
    "The Log4j vulnerability test on HTTP request headers focuses on identifying potential remote code execution risks by injecting crafted payloads into headers like `User-Agent` or `X-Forwarded-For`. When the server logs these headers without proper sanitization, it may trigger the Log4j vulnerability (CVE-2021-44228). This testing approach helps assess how vulnerable an application might be to this exploit, which was widely abused for unauthorized access and control over affected systems."
  impact: >
    "The impact of a Log4j vulnerability in HTTP request headers can be severe, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially leading to full system compromise. Once exploited, this vulnerability may enable unauthorized access, data theft, and even deployment of malware like ransomware. Left unchecked, such weaknesses can escalate quickly, jeopardizing sensitive information and critical infrastructure."
