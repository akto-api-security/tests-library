  name: "Time based SQL injection test for SQLITE DB"
  description: >
    "Time-based SQL injection for SQLite DB is a technique where an attacker exploits a vulnerability by introducing a time delay in the database's response. This is done by injecting a query that causes the database to pause for a specified period if the injection is successful. The delay indicates that the SQL injection attempt was successful, even without direct feedback from the database. This method is particularly useful for blind SQL injection scenarios."
  details: >
    "Time-based SQL injection for SQLite DB is an exploitation technique that introduces deliberate delays in the database's response to infer the presence of vulnerabilities. By injecting SQL queries that use time delay functions, an attacker can determine the success of the injection based on the response time. This technique is effective in blind SQL injection scenarios where the application does not return error messages or query results directly. It helps in identifying and exploiting SQL injection flaws even when direct feedback from the database is not available."
  impact: >
    "The impact of a time-based SQL injection on a SQLite DB can be severe, potentially allowing attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands and gain unauthorized access to sensitive data. This can lead to data breaches, data manipulation, and loss of database integrity. Additionally, the exploitation can disrupt the database's performance, causing delays and affecting the application's availability and user experience."
