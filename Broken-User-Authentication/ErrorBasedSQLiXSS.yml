  name: "Error based SQL Injection Test with XSS"
  description: >
    "Error-based SQL Injection testing with XSS involves exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities by deliberately causing SQL errors that reveal database information. Attackers inject malicious queries designed to trigger errors, extracting data from the error messages. By incorporating XSS payloads into these queries, attackers can also inject malicious scripts into the application's output. This combined approach helps identify and mitigate vulnerabilities that expose both database structure and enable client-side script execution."
  details: >
    "Error-based SQL Injection testing with XSS involves injecting SQL queries that intentionally cause database errors, which in turn reveal detailed information about the database structure and contents through error messages. Attackers craft these queries to include XSS payloads, aiming to inject malicious scripts into the application's output. This testing method identifies vulnerabilities that not only expose sensitive database information but also allow for client-side script execution, highlighting critical security flaws in the application's error handling and input validation."
  impact: >
    "The impact of Error-based SQL Injection combined with XSS can be significant, as it exposes sensitive database information through error messages and enables the execution of malicious scripts in the client's browser. This dual vulnerability can lead to unauthorized data access, data leakage, and manipulation, as well as client-side attacks that compromise user sessions, steal credentials, and spread malware. Consequently, it poses severe risks to the application's integrity, user privacy, and overall security, potentially resulting in financial loss and reputational damage."
