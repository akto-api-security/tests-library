  name: "Broken Authentication Test - Username Enumeration via Response time analysis"
  description: > 
    "This test is a security assessment method focused on detecting vulnerabilities in 
    authentication systems. By scrutinizing the response times of authentication attempts, 
    it aims to discern subtle differences that may reveal the validity of provided usernames. 
    This approach leverages variations in response times to uncover potential weaknesses, 
    aiding in the prevention of username enumeration attacks."
  details: >
    "This test is a security evaluation method that scrutinizes authentication systems for 
    vulnerabilities. It involves analyzing response times during login attempts to discern 
    patterns that may expose valid usernames. By leveraging variations in response times, 
    this test helps identify and address potential weaknesses, fortifying systems against 
    the risk of unauthorized username enumeration attacks."
  impact: >
    "The impact of this test can be severe, as it exposes the vulnerability of authentication 
    systems to unauthorized access attempts. By discerning valid usernames through response 
    time patterns, attackers gain a crucial foothold for launching targeted attacks, such 
    as brute force or phishing campaigns. This can lead to unauthorized access, data 
    breaches, and compromise of sensitive information, posing significant risks to the 
    security and integrity of the affected systems and user accounts."
