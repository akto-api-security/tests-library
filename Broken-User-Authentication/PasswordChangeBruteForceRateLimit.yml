  name: "Authentication Bypass by Brute Forcing Password Change Endpoint"
  description: > 
    "Authentication Bypass by Brute Forcing Password Change Endpoint involves attempting 
    unauthorized access by systematically guessing passwords through repeated requests to 
    the password change endpoint. In this method, attackers add random headers while 
    keeping the request body constant to evade detection. This technique aims to exploit 
    weaknesses in authentication mechanisms, highlighting the importance of implementing 
    robust rate-limiting and account lockout measures to thwart brute force attacks and 
    enhance overall system security."
  details: >
    "Authentication Bypass by Brute Forcing Password Change Endpoint is a security threat 
    where attackers attempt unauthorized access by systematically guessing passwords 
    through repetitive requests to the password change endpoint. In this scenario, random 
    headers are added while maintaining the same request body, aiming to bypass detection 
    mechanisms. To mitigate this risk, implementing effective rate-limiting and account 
    lockout measures is crucial, fortifying the authentication system against brute 
    force attacks and bolstering overall security."
  impact: >
    "The impact of Authentication Bypass by Brute Forcing Password Change Endpoint 
    can be severe, as attackers gain unauthorized access by systematically guessing 
    passwords. This method, aided by random headers to avoid detection, may lead to 
    compromised user accounts and potential unauthorized manipulation of sensitive 
    data. Implementing robust defense mechanisms, such as account lockout and 
    rate-limiting, is essential to mitigate this threat, ensuring the protection 
    of user credentials and reinforcing the overall security of the system."
  remediation: "To mitigate Authentication Bypass by Brute Forcing Password Change Endpoint, implement robust rate-limiting and account lockout measures. Enforce strict limits on the number of password change attempts within a given time frame to prevent brute force attacks. Implement account lockout mechanisms to temporarily suspend accounts after a certain number of failed login attempts. Additionally, monitor and analyze authentication logs for suspicious activity and block IP addresses or user agents that exhibit unusual behavior. Regularly update and patch the password change endpoint to address any identified vulnerabilities and strengthen security measures."
