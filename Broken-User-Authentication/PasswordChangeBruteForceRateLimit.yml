info:
  name: "Authentication Bypass by Brute Forcing Password Change Endpoint"
  description: >
    "Authentication Bypass by Brute Forcing Password Change Endpoint involves attempting  unauthorized access by systematically guessing passwords through repeated requests to  the password change endpoint. In this method, attackers add random headers while  keeping the request body constant to evade detection. This technique aims to exploit  weaknesses in authentication mechanisms, highlighting the importance of implementing  robust rate-limiting and account lockout measures to thwart brute force attacks and  enhance overall system security."
  details: >
    "Authentication Bypass by Brute Forcing Password Change Endpoint is a security threat  where attackers attempt unauthorized access by systematically guessing passwords  through repetitive requests to the password change endpoint. In this scenario, random  headers are added while maintaining the same request body, aiming to bypass detection  mechanisms. To mitigate this risk, implementing effective rate-limiting and account  lockout measures is crucial, fortifying the authentication system against brute  force attacks and bolstering overall security."
  impact: >
    "The impact of Authentication Bypass by Brute Forcing Password Change Endpoint  can be severe, as attackers gain unauthorized access by systematically guessing  passwords. This method, aided by random headers to avoid detection, may lead to  compromised user accounts and potential unauthorized manipulation of sensitive  data. Implementing robust defense mechanisms, such as account lockout and  rate-limiting, is essential to mitigate this threat, ensuring the protection  of user credentials and reinforcing the overall security of the system."
