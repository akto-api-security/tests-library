  name: "User Enumeration using Locked Account Role"
  description: > 
    "In a Broken Authentication test involving user enumeration via account lock, 
    security assessors aim to identify vulnerabilities in an application's authentication 
    mechanism. By intentionally triggering account lockouts through multiple login 
    attempts, they assess whether the system inadvertently discloses valid usernames 
    or provides distinguishing responses for valid and invalid accounts. This testing 
    approach helps uncover potential security weaknesses in account lockout policies, 
    aiding in the prevention of user enumeration attacks that could assist malicious 
    actors in identifying valid user accounts for further exploitation."

    "During a Broken Authentication test focusing on user enumeration via account lock, 
    security assessments involve intentionally triggering account lockouts through 
    multiple login attempts. The objective is to identify whether the system reveals 
    valid usernames or exhibits distinguishable responses for valid and invalid 
    accounts. This testing method helps uncover vulnerabilities in account lockout 
    policies, preventing potential user enumeration attacks and fortifying the 
    application against unauthorized access attempts."
  impact: >
    "The impact of a Broken Authentication test revealing user enumeration via account 
    lock can be severe, potentially exposing valid usernames and aiding malicious 
    actors in targeted attacks. Knowledge of valid user accounts allows for more 
    focused and successful exploitation attempts, such as brute force attacks or 
    phishing. Mitigation measures involve strengthening account lockout policies, 
    implementing robust user verification processes, and conducting regular security 
    assessments to identify and address vulnerabilities in the authentication system."
