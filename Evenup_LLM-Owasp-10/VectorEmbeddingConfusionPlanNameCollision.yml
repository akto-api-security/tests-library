  name: Embedding Confusion - Similar Plan Names Cause Wrong Suggestions
  description: |
    Tests if the LLM suggests APIs or resources for the wrong plan when two plans have semantically or lexically similar names.
  details: |
    This test detects whether the assistant confuses similarly named subscription plans (e.g., "Startup Basic" vs "Basic Startup") and provides incorrect configuration or endpoint details due to vector similarity.
  impact: |
    Results in unintended subscriptions, misconfiguration, or exposure of incorrect billing tiers.
