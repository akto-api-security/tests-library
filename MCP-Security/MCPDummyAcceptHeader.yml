info:
  name: Dummy Accept Header (MCP)
  description: |
    "This vulnerability occurs when an application does not properly validate or handle Accept headers in HTTP requests, allowing for potential exploitation through invalid or unexpected header values."
  details: |
    "By sending a dummy Accept header with a value of 'application/cats', an attacker can iteratively test all paths and HTTP methods of the application. The goal is to provoke a response from the server that reveals how it handles unexpected content types. The server's failure to reject the request appropriately may expose underlying issues in content negotiation."
  impact: |
    "Improper handling of Accept headers can lead to unexpected behavior in the application, including the potential exposure of sensitive endpoints, mis-routing of requests, or information disclosure through error messages. The consistent receipt of a 406 Not Acceptable response indicates that the application correctly rejects unsupported media types, but any other response may suggest vulnerabilities in the API's content negotiation logic."
