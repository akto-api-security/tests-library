info:
  name: Input Validation by Replacing Param with Array (MCP)
  description: |
    This test analyzes the application's response when parameters expected to be a single value are replaced with arrays.
  details: |
    The test involves submitting requests where parameters are altered to be arrays, allowing for observation of the application’s validation and error handling.
  impact: |
    Insufficient input validation may cause processing errors, unexpected application behavior, or the potential for exploitation through malformed input.
