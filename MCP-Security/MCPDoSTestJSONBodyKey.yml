info:
  name: "Denial of Service test by entering long and random strings in JSON Body Keys (MCP)"
  description: "In this Denial of Service (DoS) test, lengthy and randomized strings are injected into the keys of JSON Body Parameters. By overwhelming the system with such inputs, testers assess how the application handles excessive data loads in key-value pairs. This evaluation helps uncover potential vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the system's parsing and processing capabilities, aiding in the fortification against DoS attacks."
  details: "In this testing scenario, the focus lies on manipulating the keys of JSON Body parameters by injecting lengthy and random strings. By inundating the system with such inputs, testers analyze how the application manages the parsing and processing of these parameters. This method aims to uncover vulnerabilities in key handling mechanisms, providing insights into potential weaknesses that malicious actors could exploit to disrupt the system's functionality through Denial of Service (DoS) attacks."
  impact: "The impact of successful Denial of Service (DoS) attacks via manipulation of JSON Body Parameter keys can be significant. It may result in system slowdowns, unresponsiveness, or complete service outages, disrupting normal operations. Additionally, such attacks could compromise the availability and reliability of the system, leading to financial losses and reputational damage due to the perception of inadequate security measures."
