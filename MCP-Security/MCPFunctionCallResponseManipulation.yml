  name: Function Call Manipulation - Response Handling Manipulation (MCP)
  description: |
    Tests whether function call responses can be manipulated to alter system behavior or inject malicious content into the processing pipeline.
  details: |
    Function call manipulation includes "response handling" vulnerabilities. This test evaluates if the system properly validates and sanitizes function call responses before using them in subsequent operations. Malicious function responses can inject prompts, commands, or data that alter the AI agent's behavior or compromise downstream systems.<br>
    <b>Background:</b> MCP servers often use function/tool responses to inform subsequent decisions and actions. If these responses aren't properly validated, an attacker who controls a tool's output (or exploits a vulnerable tool) can inject malicious content that manipulates the agent's reasoning, triggers additional unauthorized function calls, or injects data into user-facing outputs.
  impact: |
    Successful response manipulation can lead to:
    1. Prompt injection through tool responses
    2. Agent behavior manipulation via crafted outputs
    3. Cross-function attack propagation
    4. Data injection into user responses
    5. Triggering of unintended follow-up actions
    6. Bypassing output filtering through tool response channels
  remediation: |
    To prevent function call response manipulation vulnerabilities:
    
    1. **Output Sanitization**: Implement strict sanitization of all function outputs before using them in agent context. Remove or escape HTML, scripts, and prompt injection patterns.
    
    2. **Response Validation**: Validate function responses against expected schemas and content types. Reject responses that don't match expected formats.
    
    3. **Content Filtering**: Apply content filters to detect and block malicious patterns in function outputs, including prompt injection attempts and command-like strings.
    
    4. **Context Isolation**: Isolate function outputs from the main agent context to prevent direct influence on reasoning and decision-making.
    
    5. **Output Allowlisting**: Use allowlists for function outputs, only permitting expected content types and formats.
    
    6. **Monitoring and Logging**: Monitor function outputs for suspicious patterns and log all function call responses for security analysis.
    
    7. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling that doesn't expose sensitive information or reflect user input in error messages.
    
    8. **Trust Boundaries**: Establish clear trust boundaries between different function outputs and the main agent processing pipeline.
