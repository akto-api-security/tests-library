  name: Function Call Manipulation - Direct Method Field Manipulation (MCP)
  description: |
    Tests whether the MCP server can be manipulated into executing unauthorized functions by directly modifying the 'method' field in the JSON-RPC request.
  details: |
    This test attempts to invoke unauthorized or privileged functions by directly replacing the method field with administrative, internal, or dangerous function names. This is the most straightforward form of unauthorized function invocation where attackers try to call functions they shouldn't have access to.<br>
    <b>Background:</b> The JSON-RPC 'method' field specifies which operation to execute. If the server doesn't properly validate and authorize which methods a user can invoke, attackers can call privileged functions simply by changing this field. This test focuses specifically on method-level access control.
  impact: |
    Successful direct method manipulation enables:
    1. Execution of administrative functions (deleteAllUsers, resetSystem)
    2. Access to internal debugging functions (dumpDatabase, getSecrets)
    3. System configuration changes via privileged methods
    4. Complete bypass of intended API surface
    5. Direct access to dangerous operations
  remediation: |
    To prevent direct method manipulation vulnerabilities:
    
    1. **Method Allowlisting**: Implement strict allowlists of permitted methods. Only allow predefined, authorized methods and reject any attempts to call unauthorized functions.
    
    2. **Input Validation**: Validate the method field against a predefined list of allowed methods. Reject requests with unknown or unauthorized method names.
    
    3. **Authentication and Authorization**: Implement proper authentication and authorization checks for each method call. Verify that the requesting user has permission to execute the specific method.
    
    4. **Method Mapping**: Use internal method mapping instead of direct method invocation. Map external method names to internal function calls with proper validation.
    
    5. **Request Sanitization**: Sanitize and validate all method names before processing. Remove or escape special characters that could be used for injection.
    
    6. **Access Control Lists**: Maintain access control lists (ACLs) that define which users or roles can execute specific methods.
    
    7. **Method Signatures**: Validate method signatures and parameters to ensure they match expected formats before execution.
    
    8. **Audit Logging**: Log all method invocation attempts, including successful and failed attempts, for security monitoring and forensics.
    
    9. **Error Handling**: Implement secure error handling that doesn't reveal information about available methods or internal system details.
    
    10. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting on method calls to prevent abuse and potential DoS attacks.
