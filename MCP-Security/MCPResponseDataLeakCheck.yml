info:
  name: Sensitive Data Leakage
  description: |
    This test ensures that responses from MCP servers do not expose internal implementation details, sensitive user data, or system secrets.
  details: |
    The test sends a valid request to the MCP server and inspects the response body to identify any unintended exposure of internal components or user-related information. This helps validate that the MCP server does not leak data that could assist in exploitation or reconnaissance.
  impact: |
    If the MCP server response contains internal, sensitive, or user-specific data, it could lead to security breaches, data leakage, or unauthorized access to protected resources.
