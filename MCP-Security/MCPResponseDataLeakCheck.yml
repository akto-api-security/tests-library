info:
  name: MCP Response Data Leak Check
  description: |
    This test ensures that responses from MCP servers do not expose internal implementation details, sensitive user data, or system secrets.
  details: |
    The test sends a valid request to the MCP server and inspects the response body to identify any unintended exposure of internal components or user-related information. This helps validate that the MCP server does not leak data that could assist in exploitation or reconnaissance.
  impact: |
    If the MCP server response contains internal, sensitive, or user-specific data, it could lead to security breaches, data leakage, or unauthorized access to protected resources.

      $magic Analyze the response for signs of sensitive or internal data leakage. Flag values that meet any of the following: - Credentials or secrets (e.g., tokens, API keys, passwords, base64 or JWT-like blobs) - Internal service references (e.g., internal URLs, IPs like 10.x.x.x, *.internal domains, localhost, local domains) - Debug traces, error dumps, or stack traces. - User data (emails, phone numbers, names) ONLY IF: - It's unrelated to the current authenticated user, or - Appears inside debug, tool, or error responses unexpectedly
      Do not flag business response fields unless they contain sensitive-looking values. Focus on the content of the values, not field names. Return only red-flag values. Return an empty list if nothing suspicious is found.
