info:
  name: "Reflective Command Execution using MCP Direct Prompt Injection"
  description: |
    Tests whether the MCP server reflects attacker-controlled input back in responses, 
    enabling Direct Prompt Injection attacks. When a server echoes malicious payloads 
    from request parameters back to the LLM, it can trick the AI agent into executing 
    those reflected instructions as legitimate commands, bypassing security controls.
  details: |
    This test systematically injects a unique marker into each request parameter and 
    validates whether the server reflects it back in the response. The test works by:
    
    1. Iterating through all request parameters (jsonrpc, method, params, and nested fields)
    2. Replacing each parameter value with a unique marker string (REFLECTIVE_INVALID_MARKER_7F3A9)
    3. Sending the modified request to the MCP server
    4. Checking if the response payload contains the exact marker value
    
    If the marker is found in the response, it indicates the server is unsafely echoing 
    user input. When an LLM processes this reflected content, it may interpret the echoed 
    text as legitimate system output and execute embedded malicious instructions. This 
    creates a Direct Prompt Injection vulnerability where attackers can inject commands 
    that get reflected and then executed in the LLM's context.
    
    The test validates all parameters to ensure comprehensive coverage of potential 
    reflection points in the MCP request/response cycle.
  impact: |
    Reflective responses enable Direct Prompt Injection attacks with severe consequences:
    - Command Execution: Reflected malicious prompts can instruct the LLM to execute 
      arbitrary commands or tool calls
    - Data Exfiltration: Attackers can inject instructions to extract sensitive data 
      from the agent's context or memory
    - Authorization Bypass: Reflected instructions can manipulate the LLM into 
      performing unauthorized actions
    - Tool Poisoning: Injected commands can alter tool behavior or invoke malicious tools
    - Session Hijacking: Reflected payloads can steal credentials or session tokens
    - SSRF and Callback Attacks: Embedded URLs in reflected content can trigger 
      outbound connections to attacker-controlled servers
    
    This vulnerability is particularly dangerous because the LLM trusts server responses 
    as authoritative, making reflected attacker input highly effective for manipulation.
