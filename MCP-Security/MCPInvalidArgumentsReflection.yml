  name: "Reflective Command Execution using MCP Direct Prompt Injection"
  description: |
    Tests whether the MCP server reflects attacker-controlled input back in responses, 
    enabling Direct Prompt Injection attacks. When a server echoes malicious payloads 
    from request parameters back to the LLM, it can trick the AI agent into executing 
    those reflected instructions as legitimate commands, bypassing security controls.
  details: |
    This test systematically injects a unique marker into each request parameter and 
    validates whether the server reflects it back in the response. The test works by:
    
    1. Iterating through all request parameters (jsonrpc, method, params, and nested fields)
    2. Replacing each parameter value with a unique marker string (REFLECTIVE_INVALID_MARKER_7F3A9)
    3. Sending the modified request to the MCP server
    4. Checking if the response payload contains the exact marker value
    
    If the marker is found in the response, it indicates the server is unsafely echoing 
    user input. When an LLM processes this reflected content, it may interpret the echoed 
    text as legitimate system output and execute embedded malicious instructions. This 
    creates a Direct Prompt Injection vulnerability where attackers can inject commands 
    that get reflected and then executed in the LLM's context.
    
    The test validates all parameters to ensure comprehensive coverage of potential 
    reflection points in the MCP request/response cycle.
  impact: |
    Reflective responses enable Direct Prompt Injection attacks with severe consequences:
    - Command Execution: Reflected malicious prompts can instruct the LLM to execute 
      arbitrary commands or tool calls
    - Data Exfiltration: Attackers can inject instructions to extract sensitive data 
      from the agent's context or memory
    - Authorization Bypass: Reflected instructions can manipulate the LLM into 
      performing unauthorized actions
    - Tool Poisoning: Injected commands can alter tool behavior or invoke malicious tools
    - Session Hijacking: Reflected payloads can steal credentials or session tokens
    - SSRF and Callback Attacks: Embedded URLs in reflected content can trigger 
      outbound connections to attacker-controlled servers
    
    This vulnerability is particularly dangerous because the LLM trusts server responses 
    as authoritative, making reflected attacker input highly effective for manipulation.
  remediation: |
    To prevent reflective responses for invalid arguments:
    
    1. **Input Sanitization**: Sanitize all user input before processing. Remove or escape special characters, HTML tags, scripts, and prompt injection patterns that could be reflected back.
    
    2. **Error Message Standardization**: Use standardized, generic error messages that don't include user input or request details. Avoid echoing back request content in error responses.
    
    3. **Response Filtering**: Implement response filters to detect and remove potentially malicious content before sending responses to clients or LLM agents.
    
    4. **Input Validation**: Validate all request parameters and reject malformed requests early in the processing pipeline without echoing the input back.
    
    5. **Content Security Headers**: Use appropriate HTTP headers to prevent content injection and ensure responses are properly encoded.
    
    6. **Logging Separation**: Log detailed error information separately from user-facing responses. Keep sensitive debugging information in secure logs only.
    
    7. **LLM Context Isolation**: If responses are consumed by LLM agents, implement strict context boundaries to prevent reflected content from influencing agent behavior.
    
    8. **Response Templates**: Use predefined response templates for error conditions instead of dynamically constructing responses that might include user input.
    
    9. **Argument Validation**: Implement strict validation of function arguments against expected schemas and reject requests with invalid or unexpected parameters.
    
    10. **Prompt Injection Detection**: Implement detection mechanisms for prompt injection patterns in user input and block or sanitize such content before processing.
