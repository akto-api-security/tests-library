  name: Session Hijacking via Prompt Injection (MCP)
  description: |
    Tests for session hijacking through prompt injection in stateful MCP servers with shared queues.
  details: |
    This test simulates the "Session Hijack Prompt Injection" attack described in MCP Security Best Practices.
    Attack flow for stateful MCP servers with shared queues:
    1. Client connects to Server A and receives a session ID
    2. Attacker obtains an existing session ID and sends malicious event to Server B with that session ID
    3. Server B enqueues the event (associated with session ID) into a shared queue
    4. Server A polls the queue using the session ID and retrieves the malicious payload
    5. Server A sends the malicious payload to the client as an asynchronous or resumed response
    
    The test injects malicious tool notification payloads that could affect tools offered by the server or 
    inject instructions that get executed in the victim's session context.
  impact: |
    Successful session hijack prompt injection allows attackers to:
    - Inject malicious tool notifications into victim sessions
    - Modify the list of available tools seen by the victim
    - Execute commands in the victim's security context
    - Manipulate server-sent events received by legitimate users
    - Potentially achieve remote code execution through tool manipulation
