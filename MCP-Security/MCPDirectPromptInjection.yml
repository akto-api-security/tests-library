  name: MCP Direct Prompt Injection - Malicious User Input
  description: |
    This test checks whether direct malicious instructions embedded in user input prompts are executed by the LLM, causing unauthorized actions or behavior manipulation.
  details: |
    Attackers inject explicit commands or phrases directly within the user’s prompt input to override system instructions or safety filters.
    Common payloads include instructions like "ignore previous instructions," "disregard safety rules," or "respond only with...".
    Since MCP systems often combine user input with system context, these injected commands can manipulate the LLM’s output in unintended ways.
    Detecting this vulnerability involves analyzing input prompts for suspicious patterns and monitoring responses for signs of unauthorized instruction execution.
  impact: |
    If executed, direct prompt injection can lead to:
    - **Disclosure of sensitive information** such as credentials or internal data.
    - **Bypassing content moderation** and compliance filters, potentially generating harmful or restricted content.
    - **Unintended tool invocation** causing unauthorized actions or data leakage.
    - **Operational instability** and potential system compromise.
    - **Loss of user and stakeholder trust** with legal or reputational consequences.
