info:
  name: "SSRF test for Redirect URI with State Parameter in Auth0 Authentication"
  description: "An SSRF test for Redirect URI with the state parameter in Auth0 authentication evaluates how the system handles and validates redirect URIs that include SSRF payloads within the state parameter. Testers aim to determine if the system allows internal or unintended requests through crafted state values, which could trick the server into accessing internal resources or sensitive endpoints. This test ensures that Auth0 properly sanitizes and validates the state parameter to prevent unauthorized access or exposure of internal services."
  details: "In an SSRF test for Redirect URI with the state parameter, testers inject payloads into the `state` parameter of an OAuth2 authorization request to see if Auth0 processes them in a way that could lead to internal requests. For example, by using URLs that point to internal services or localhost within the `state` parameter, testers check if Auth0 improperly redirects or accesses internal resources. This helps assess whether Auth0â€™s validation mechanisms are robust enough to prevent SSRF vulnerabilities via the state parameter."
  impact: "If an SSRF vulnerability is found in the Redirect URI with the state parameter, attackers could trick Auth0 into making requests to internal services or accessing sensitive data within the network. This could lead to unauthorized information disclosure or exposure of internal systems. Additionally, it might enable further attacks or exploitation of internal resources, compromising overall system security and user privacy."
