  name: "Next.JS Server-Side Request Forgery Test"
  description: "The Next.js Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) Test identifies vulnerabilities in a Next.js application that may allow an attacker to make unauthorized requests from the server to internal or external resources. SSRF vulnerabilities occur when an attacker can manipulate the server to send requests to unintended targets, often bypassing security controls. This could lead to information leakage, internal network attacks, or exploitation of internal services. Proper validation of user input and restricting server-side network access are essential to mitigate SSRF risks in Next.js applications."
  details: "The Next.js Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) Test examines how a Next.js application handles external or internal requests made by the server. If the application improperly processes user inputs that are used in server-side requests, an attacker could manipulate the input to trigger requests to internal services, cloud metadata APIs, or other unintended destinations. These unauthorized requests could expose sensitive information, allow internal network access, or trigger malicious actions. Mitigating SSRF in Next.js involves validating and sanitizing user inputs, using safe URLs, and restricting server access to sensitive internal endpoints."
  impact: "The impact of a Next.js Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability can be severe, as it allows attackers to make unauthorized requests from the server to internal or external systems. This could lead to the exposure of sensitive internal data, such as cloud metadata, internal APIs, or private services. Exploiting SSRF may also facilitate further attacks, such as accessing internal network resources or launching attacks on other services. Effective input validation, request whitelisting, and network access restrictions are crucial to prevent such risks."
