#APIs accepting <script> with AWS internal URL as input with redirect

info:
  name: "SSRF test via replacing parameters with script tags containing redirect URLs for AWS internal URL"
  description: "This tests involves the replacement of 
  parameters with script tags containing internal AWS URLs with redirection aiming to assess the vulnerability 
  of web applications to unauthorized server-side requests. By injecting these script 
  tags, testers evaluate whether the application can be manipulated to make 
  requests to internal resources, potentially leading to data 
  breaches or system compromise. This technique helps identify and mitigate security 
  flaws that could be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access or manipulate 
  sensitive information."
  details: "In this test, attackers replace parameters in web requests with script tags 
  containing AWS URLs with redirection pointing to malicious destinations. These malicious URLs are 
  designed to trigger server-side actions, potentially exploiting vulnerabilities 
  in the target application. By analyzing the application's response to these 
  manipulated requests, security testers assess its susceptibility to unauthorized 
  data access, internal network probing, or even remote code execution. This method 
  helps uncover and remediate SSRF vulnerabilities, safeguarding against potential 
  exploitation by malicious actors."
  impact: "The impact of SSRF vulnerabilities exploited via AWS URL 
  injections with redirection can be severe. Attackers could gain unauthorized access to 
  sensitive internal systems, databases, or cloud resources, leading to 
  data theft, manipulation, or even complete system compromise. Furthermore, 
  SSRF attacks may facilitate lateral movement within a network, enabling 
  attackers to pivot and escalate privileges, amplifying the scope and severity 
  of the breach. Without proper mitigation, these exploits pose significant 
  risks to data integrity, confidentiality, and overall system security."
