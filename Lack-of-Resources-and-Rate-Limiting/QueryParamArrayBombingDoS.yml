info:
  name: "Denial of Service test by bombing multiple Query Parameter Arrays in request"
  description: "In this Denial of Service (DoS) test, multiple Query Parameter Array 
  in a request are flooded to assess system resilience under stress. By overwhelming 
  the system with numerous parameters, testers evaluate how effectively it handles 
  and processes such inputs. This method aims to uncover vulnerabilities in 
  parameter parsing and request handling, helping fortify defenses against DoS 
  attacks targeting the application's query parameter processing capabilities."
  details: "This test involves inundating a system's request with an 
  excessive number of query parameter arrays, potentially overwhelming its capacity 
  to process incoming data. Testers assess how the system copes with this 
  barrage of parameters, scrutinizing its ability to parse and handle the 
  influx of information effectively. The objective is to uncover any 
  weaknesses in parameter handling that could be exploited by attackers 
  to disrupt the system's functionality through Denial of Service (DoS) attacks."
  impact: "A successful Denial of Service (DoS) attack via bombarding multiple query 
  parameter arrays in a request can have severe consequences. It may lead to 
  system instability, causing slowdowns, unresponsiveness, or even crashes 
  as the system struggles to process the overwhelming volume of 
  data. Additionally, service disruptions can frustrate users, 
  resulting in diminished trust and potential reputational damage 
  for the organization, highlighting vulnerabilities in its request handling mechanisms."
