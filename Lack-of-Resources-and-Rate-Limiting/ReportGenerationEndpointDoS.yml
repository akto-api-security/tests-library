  name: "Denial of Service Test on Report Generation Endpoint"
  description: "A Denial of Service (DoS) test on a report generation endpoint involves 
  overwhelming the system with a high volume of requests to assess its 
  resilience under heavy load. By bombarding the endpoint with 
  numerous simultaneous requests for report generation, testers 
  evaluate how well the system handles the load and whether it 
  remains responsive. This testing helps identify potential bottlenecks 
  or vulnerabilities in the report generation process, enabling 
  proactive measures to fortify the system's defenses against 
  DoS attacks targeting this endpoint."
  details: "In this test, the report generation endpoint is bombarded with an 
  excessive number of requests, aiming to simulate real-world peak 
  loads and stress the system. Testers assess how the endpoint 
  responds to this influx of requests, evaluating its ability 
  to maintain responsiveness and generate reports efficiently. 
  Through this process, potential weaknesses in scalability 
  and performance are identified, enabling organizations to 
  fortify their systems against Denial of Service (DoS) attacks 
  on report generation functionalities."
  impact: "A successful Denial of Service (DoS) test on a report generation endpoint 
  can have significant consequences. It may lead to system slowdowns, 
  unavailability, or crashes, hindering users' access to vital reports 
  and disrupting business operations. Additionally, prolonged 
  service disruptions can tarnish the organization's reputation, 
  eroding user trust and potentially resulting in financial 
  losses. Identifying and addressing vulnerabilities in the 
  report generation process is crucial for maintaining system 
  reliability and resilience against DoS attacks."
