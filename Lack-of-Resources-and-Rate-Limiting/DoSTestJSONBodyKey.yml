info:
  name: "Denial of Service test by entering long and random strings in 
  JSON Body Keys"
  description: "In this Denial of Service (DoS) test, lengthy and randomized strings 
  are injected into the keys of JSON Body Parameters. By overwhelming the system with 
  such inputs, testers assess how the application handles excessive data loads 
  in key-value pairs. This evaluation helps uncover potential vulnerabilities 
  and weaknesses in the system's parsing and processing capabilities, aiding 
  in the fortification against DoS attacks."
  details: "In this testing scenario, the focus lies on manipulating the keys of 
  JSON Body parameters by injecting lengthy and random strings. By inundating the 
  system with such inputs, testers analyze how the application manages the 
  parsing and processing of these parameters. This method aims to uncover 
  vulnerabilities in key handling mechanisms, providing insights into potential 
  weaknesses that malicious actors could exploit to disrupt the system's 
  functionality through Denial of Service (DoS) attacks."
  impact: "The impact of successful Denial of Service (DoS) attacks via manipulation 
  of JSON Body Parameter keys can be significant. It may result in system slowdowns, 
  unresponsiveness, or complete service outages, disrupting normal operations. 
  Additionally, such attacks could compromise the availability and reliability 
  of the system, leading to financial losses and reputational damage due to the 
  perception of inadequate security measures."
  remediation: "To mitigate Denial of Service (DoS) attacks by entering long and random strings in JSON body keys, implement input validation on the server-side to limit the length of JSON keys accepted by the application. Additionally, consider implementing rate limiting mechanisms to prevent abuse of the application's resources by limiting the number of requests processed within a certain time frame. Regularly monitor server performance and adjust validation rules and rate limits as needed to maintain optimal service availability and performance."
