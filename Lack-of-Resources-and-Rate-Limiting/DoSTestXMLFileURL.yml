info:
  name: "Denial of Service test by providing a large XML file URL as input"
  description: "This test involving inputting a large XML file URL that aims to assess a 
  system's resilience against resource exhaustion attacks. By inundating the system 
  with a hefty XML file, it evaluates its ability to handle excessive data 
  loads and maintain functionality under stress. This test simulates a 
  real-world scenario where malicious actors attempt to overwhelm a system's 
  capacity, highlighting vulnerabilities in its defense mechanisms against such attacks."
  details: "This test involves inputting a large XML file URL to flood the 
  system with data requests, aiming to overwhelm its capacity and render 
  it unresponsive. It evaluates the system's resilience against denial of 
  service (DoS) attacks, assessing its ability to handle resource exhaustion 
  and identifying potential vulnerabilities in its defense mechanisms. The test 
  focuses on the system's mitigation strategies and resilience under stress."
  impact: "The impact of this test could potentially disrupt essential services 
  and cause downtime for users reliant on the affected system. By overwhelming 
  its capacity, legitimate users may be unable to access resources, leading 
  to financial losses and reputational damage for the organization. Furthermore, 
  if left unaddressed, such vulnerabilities could be exploited by malicious actors 
  to orchestrate more severe attacks, jeopardizing data integrity and compromising 
  sensitive information."
