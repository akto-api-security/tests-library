  name: "Denial of Service test by entering long strings in 
  search field of an endpoint"
  description: "In this Denial of Service (DoS) test, excessively long strings 
  are entered into the search field of an endpoint to evaluate the system's resilience 
  against overload. By inundating the search functionality with extended inputs, 
  testers assess how the system handles and processes such requests. This 
  method helps uncover potential vulnerabilities in the search feature's 
  implementation, aiding in the enhancement of defenses against DoS attacks 
  targeting search functionalities."
  details: "In this Denial of Service (DoS) test, the search field of an 
  endpoint is bombarded with unusually long strings to evaluate the 
  system's resilience under heavy loads. Such prolonged inputs may 
  strain system resources, leading to performance degradation or 
  unresponsiveness. Consequently, users may experience delays or 
  disruptions in search functionality. By simulating these scenarios, 
  testers can identify vulnerabilities and enhance the system's defenses 
  against potential DoS attacks targeting the search feature."
  impact: "The impact of successful Denial of Service (DoS) attacks targeting the 
  search functionality of an endpoint can be substantial. It may result in 
  system slowdowns or unavailability, hindering users' ability to perform 
  essential tasks. Additionally, prolonged disruptions can erode user trust 
  and damage the organization's reputation, leading to potential financial 
  losses and diminished customer satisfaction."
  remediation: "In Denial of Service (DoS) tests by entering long strings in the search field of an endpoint, attackers attempt to overwhelm the system by inputting excessively large or deeply nested search queries. This can cause the system to consume excessive resources, leading to degraded performance or even service outage. To mitigate this risk, input validation should be implemented to limit the length and complexity of search queries, and proper resource allocation and rate limiting mechanisms should be in place to prevent abuse and ensure system stability."
