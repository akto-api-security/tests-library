info:
  name: Possible DOS attack by Pagination misconfiguration
  description: "Quite often, APIs do not impose any restrictions on the size or number of resources that can be requested by the user."
  details: "Such vulnerabilities arise when there is no max limit imposed on the number of resources returned. Typically, the number of objects to be returned is provided by a parameter in the API call. An attacker can set it as a large number. "
  impact: "This can impact the API server performance, leading to  Denial of Service (DoS). It also leaves the door open to authentication flaws such as brute force."
