  name: "Denial of Service Test on 3rd Party API endpoints using excessive Request replay"
  description: "In a Denial of Service (DoS) test on 3rd party API endpoints, excessive request replay is employed to evaluate the system's resilience against repeated requests. Testers inundate the API with an overwhelming number of requests, mimicking a real-world scenario of heavy traffic or malicious activity. This test aims to assess how effectively the API endpoint handles and mitigates the impact of such request floods, highlighting potential vulnerabilities and enabling measures to strengthen its defenses against DoS attacks."
  details: "In this test, testers repeatedly send an excessive number of requests to 3rd party API endpoints, aiming to overwhelm their capacity to handle incoming traffic. By simulating a barrage of requests, the test assesses the API's ability to maintain functionality and respond to legitimate queries amidst a flood of traffic. Identifying any weaknesses in the API's resilience helps organizations fortify their systems against potential Denial of Service (DoS) attacks targeting these endpoints."
  impact: "The impact of a successful Denial of Service (DoS) test on 3rd party API endpoints using excessive request replay can be severe. It may lead to service disruptions, causing delays or unavailability of critical functionalities for users relying on the API. Additionally, prolonged outages can result in financial losses and reputational damage, as clients and stakeholders perceive the API as unreliable or insecure. Strengthening defenses against such attacks is crucial for maintaining the stability and trustworthiness of the API infrastructure."
