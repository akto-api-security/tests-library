info:
  name: Access Control Bypass by changing request method to HEAD
  description: "Many authentication mechanisms only limit access to the most common HTTP methods, thus allowing unauthorized access to restricted resources by other HTTP methods."
  details: >
    "It may be possible to bypass authentication or authorization on this endpoint by changing the HTTP
    method to HEAD. The original request was replayed by removing victim's <b>auth</b> token. The server  responded with 2XX success codes.<br>"
    "<b>Background:</b> An access control vulnerability can arise if the server does not properly enforce  authorization checks for certain resources when the HEAD method is used. This vulnerability can allow  an attacker to bypass access controls and gain unauthorized access to restricted resources. The access  bypass control by changing the HTTP method to HEAD occurs when an attacker modifies the HTTP request  method from a restricted method (e.g., POST) to the HEAD method. By doing so, the attacker aims to  exploit the server's vulnerability in handling authorization checks for the HEAD method, which may  differ from other methods."
  impact: "Broken User authentication is a serious vulnerability. Attackers can gain control to other user's accounts in the system, read their personal data, and perform sensitive actions on their behalf, like money transactions and sending personal messages."
