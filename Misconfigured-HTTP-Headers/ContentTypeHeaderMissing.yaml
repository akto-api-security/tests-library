info:
  name: Content Type Header Missing
  description: "This vulnerability can enable attackers to inject malicious code into the application or cause it to malfunction."
  details: >
            "The endpoint appears to be have Misconfigured HTTP Headers. The original request
            was replayed without any modifications. The server responded with 2XX success codes and the
            response headers didn't contain Content-Type header"
            "<b>Background:</b> The Content-Type header specifies the type of data contained in the request or
            response body, allowing the receiving party to interpret and handle the data correctly."
  impact: "When the Content-Type header is missing, it can lead to various security risks, data integrity issues and possible DOS attacks"
  remediation: "To mitigate the risk of missing Content-Type headers, ensure that your application consistently sets the Content-Type header for all responses. Implement a validation mechanism to enforce the presence of the Content-Type header in all requests and responses. Additionally, configure your web server or application framework to automatically set appropriate Content-Type headers when serving different types of content. Regularly audit your codebase to ensure that Content-Type headers are correctly set in all parts of your application. By enforcing proper header handling, you can prevent potential security vulnerabilities and ensure compatibility with various client applications."
