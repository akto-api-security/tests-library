info:
  name: Missing HTTP Request Headers
  description: "The request does not contain some HTTP security headers."
  details: >
    "The endpoint seems to be missing some HTTP security headers which provide yet another layer of  security by helping to mitigate attacks and security vulnerabilities.<br>"
    "<b>Background:</b> Whenever a browser requests a page from a web server, the server responds with  the content along with HTTP request headers. Some of these headers contain content meta data such  as the Content-Encoding, Cache-Control, status codes, etc. Along with these are also HTTP security  headers that tell your browser how to behave when handling your website's content. For example,  by using the Strict-Transport-Security you can force the browser to communicate solely over HTTPS."
  impact: "This information can be used to facilitate more sophisticated attacks on your application."
