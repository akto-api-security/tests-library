  name: "Timestamp Disclosure - Unix"
  description: >
    "This scan identifies instances where Unix timestamps are disclosed in HTTP responses or other areas of the application. Timestamps can provide attackers with useful information about the server, system, or the application's internal workings, such as when a resource was created or modified."
  details: >
    "Unix timestamps, typically represented as the number of seconds since January 1, 1970 (UTC), are often used in systems to record the time of an event. When these timestamps are exposed in server responses, they can provide attackers with valuable information. For instance, timestamps may reveal server-side activity, such as the creation of records, session start times, or cache-related information. This information can be used in further attacks or to plan a targeted attack based on timing and activity patterns."
  impact: >
    "The disclosure of Unix timestamps, while not directly leading to system compromise, can provide attackers with key details that may aid in attacks. For example, timestamp information can be used to infer the timing of critical operations, identify potential session lifetimes, or analyze cache expiration patterns. In some cases, attackers may use this data to mount replay attacks or time-based attacks. It's important to avoid unnecessary exposure of timestamps and other sensitive information to reduce the application's attack surface."
