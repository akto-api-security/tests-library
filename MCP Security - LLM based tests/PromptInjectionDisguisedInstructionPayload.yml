info:
  name: Prompt Injection - Disguised Instruction via Structured Payload
  description: 'Attempts to override model alignment by embedding hidden instructions
    in structured templates like legal letters, contracts, or documentation. '
  details: 'These prompts disguise malicious instructions as formal fields or explanatory
    placeholders, increasing the chance of execution by the LLM while appearing innocuous
    to humans. '
  impact: 'May trigger internal instruction leak, biased completions, or logic override
    through instruction framing abuse. '
