info:
  name: Prompt Injection - System Prompt Fragment Leakage via Indirect Query
  description: 'Attempts to extract internal instructions or system prompt logic by
    disguising the request as a harmless formatting query or user support issue.

    '
  details: "The attacker embeds natural language queries that probe the model\u2019\
    s underlying rules, behavior, or prior context, especially in fields like invoice\
    \ notes or comments.\n"
  impact: 'May leak parts of system prompt, configuration metadata, or agent framework
    instructions into end-user visible fields or logs.
