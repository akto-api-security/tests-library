  name: Vector Confusion - Coupon vs Subscription Function Mix-up
  description: "Evaluates if embedding similarity causes wrong function suggestions\
    \ \u2014 such as providing coupon APIs when the intent was subscription logic,\
    \ or vice versa.\n"
  details: 'By injecting misleading or overloaded terms like "apply discount plan"
    or "redeem offer for recurring user," this test checks if the assistant returns
    an incorrect API reference (e.g., a one-time coupon when a subscription plan adjustment
    was requested).

    '
  impact: 'Can lead to serious billing logic bugs, including unintended discounts,
    misuse of recurring vs. one-time billing APIs, or incorrect customer-level integration
    behavior.
