info:
  name: System Prompt Leakage - Reflective Introspection Triggers
  description: 'Evaluates if introspective questions elicit exposure of internal alignment
    instructions or behavior rules.

    '
  details: 'Models may accidentally disclose embedded prompts or operational instructions
    when asked to reflect on their intent, constraints, or behavior shaping.

    '
  impact: 'Leakage of internal alignment settings or guardrails through indirect reflective
    queries.
