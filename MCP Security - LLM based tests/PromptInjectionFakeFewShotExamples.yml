  name: Prompt Injection - Fake Few-Shot Example Injection
  description: 'Evaluates whether the model follows crafted few-shot examples embedded
    in user prompts that mimic training data or demonstration logic.
    '
  details: 'Attacker adds fabricated instructions framed as valid examples of expected
    input-output pairs to override system behavior, often slipping them into fields
    like comments or sample payloads.
    '
  impact: 'May result in hallucinated completions, policy bypasses, or faulty automation
    due to misinterpreted few-shot demonstrations.
