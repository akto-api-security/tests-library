  name: Vector Confusion - Misleading API Suggestion via Similar Prompt
  description: 'Tests if ambiguous or intentionally misphrased prompts return incorrect
    but semantically "close" API suggestions, leading to possible misuse.

    '
  details: "Designed to simulate cases where developers mistype or conflate invoice\
    \ and subscription endpoints \u2014 e.g., asking for \"subscription voiding\"\
    \ may return invoice deletion APIs if vectors collide.\n"
  impact: 'Can result in critical misuse of wrong API endpoints, especially in billing
    systems where subscriptions, plans, coupons, and invoices have separate but similarly
    named functions.
