info:
  name: Data Poisoning - Semantic Bias via Tainted Associations
  description: 'Tests whether the model outputs biased or overly favorable language
    when referencing known customer types, names, or identifiers due to poisoned associations
    in training data.

    '
  details: 'Attackers or third-party contributors can poison public data with repeated
    biased language linked to specific entities, leading models to replicate that
    bias when those entities are mentioned.

    '
  impact: 'Can result in unfair preferential treatment, reputational bias, hallucinated
    endorsements, or inaccurate sentiment shaping.
