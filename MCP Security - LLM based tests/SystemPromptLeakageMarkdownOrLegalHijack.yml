info:
  name: System Prompt Leakage - Formatting-Based Prompt Disclosure
  description: 'Evaluates if the model leaks internal instruction sets or behavioral
    patterns when prompted via markdown, legal tone, or content simulation that induces
    summarization.

    '
  details: 'Exploits structured formatting (e.g., contracts, markdown sections) to
    extract internal descriptions of assistant roles or response strategies.

    '
  impact: 'May expose guardrails, disclaimer strategies, or the system prompt responsible
    for aligning model outputs.
