  name: Improper Output Handling - Unvalidated URL Reflection
  description: 'Tests if untrusted user input containing suspicious or non-whitelisted
    URLs is reflected into structured output fields like invoice comments or webhook
    configs.

    '
  details: 'Attackers may inject URLs with tracking, phishing domains, localhost references,
    or internal addresses. Improper echoing of such content into structured output
    may result in link spoofing, redirection, or information leaks if used downstream.

    '
  impact: 'Reflected URLs may compromise user trust, expose internal systems, or open
    up redirect-based attacks if displayed in web UI or logged.

      - $magic Carefully analyze the full API request and response. Determine if the
        response includes any reflected URLs from the request that are internal (e.g.
        localhost, private IPs), suspicious (e.g. unexpected TLDs), or potentially
        unsafe (e.g. links to tracking, debug, or admin endpoints). Flag if any such
        URLs are unvalidated and appear in the output fields like comments, notes,
        or webhook configs.
