  name: "AWS Misconfigured CDN Cache Poisoning"
  description: "AWS Misconfigured CDN Cache Poisoning refers to a security vulnerability where improper configuration of a Content Delivery Network (CDN) allows attackers to inject malicious content into the cache. When users request resources, they may receive compromised content instead of legitimate data. This can lead to data theft, malware distribution, or misinformation, undermining user trust and potentially exposing sensitive information. To mitigate this risk, organizations must ensure proper cache configurations, including strict validation of cached content and security policies."
  details: "AWS Misconfigured CDN Cache Poisoning occurs when a CDN, such as Amazon CloudFront, is not properly configured to validate or sanitize incoming requests and cached content. Attackers can exploit this misconfiguration by sending crafted requests that manipulate the cached responses, allowing them to store malicious data. When legitimate users request resources from the CDN, they may receive these poisoned responses, which can lead to various threats, such as phishing, data exfiltration, or the spread of malware. Proper cache control headers, input validation, and monitoring of cached content are essential to prevent this vulnerability."
  impact: "The impact of AWS Misconfigured CDN Cache Poisoning can be significant, as it allows attackers to serve malicious content to unsuspecting users, potentially leading to data breaches and malware infections. Users may unknowingly download compromised files or be redirected to malicious sites, resulting in phishing attacks and loss of sensitive information. Additionally, this vulnerability can damage an organization's reputation, erode customer trust, and lead to financial losses from remediation efforts and potential legal liabilities. Moreover, regulatory compliance issues may arise if sensitive user data is exposed, leading to further penalties."
