info:
  name: Tyk Health Check Exposed
  description: >
    This vulnerability involves the exposure of health check endpoints in Tyk, which can provide sensitive information about the API gateway and its operational status.
  details: >
    The health check endpoints may return information about the Tyk instance's health, configuration, and current load, which could potentially be leveraged by an attacker to understand the system better and identify other vulnerabilities.
  impact: >
    Exposing health check information can lead to unauthorized access, where attackers can exploit the information to perform further attacks against the API gateway or underlying services. Proper access controls should be implemented to secure these endpoints.
