info:
  name: Nginx Default Page Enabled 
  description: Detection of Nginx default page enabled misconfiguration, potentially exposing sensitive server information.
  details: >
        The Nginx Default Page Enabled test identifies a security misconfiguration where the default Nginx page is 
        accessible. The test checks if the response payload contains the string "Welcome to nginx!" indicating that
        the default page is enabled. This misconfiguration can potentially expose sensitive server information,
        such as the version of Nginx and other configuration details, to attackers. It falls under the Security
        Misconfiguration category with a low severity level. Disabling the default Nginx page and customizing
        error pages helps protect sensitive server information and enhance security.
  impact: Enabling Nginx default page exposes sensitive server information, potentially aiding attackers in crafting targeted attacks and exploiting vulnerabilities.
  remediation: "To mitigate the risk of having the Nginx default page enabled, customize a default landing page to provide minimal information about the server and application, avoiding sensitive disclosures. Disable the default Nginx page in production environments by removing or renaming the default configuration file. Implement access controls to restrict access to sensitive resources and directories, enhancing the overall security of the Nginx server."
