info:
  name: "Django Open Redirect"
  description: "The Django Open Redirect vulnerability occurs when a Django application improperly validates URLs used for redirection, allowing attackers to manipulate redirect parameters. This flaw can enable attackers to craft URLs that redirect users to malicious sites, which may lead to phishing attacks or other malicious activities. Exploiting this vulnerability compromises user trust and can result in sensitive information being exposed. Proper validation and sanitization of redirect URLs are crucial to mitigate this security risk."
  details: "The Django Open Redirect vulnerability typically arises from the misuse of the `redirect` function in Django applications without proper validation of user-supplied input. When developers allow redirect parameters to be based on user input without stringent checks, attackers can craft URLs that lead users to untrusted external sites. This flaw can be particularly dangerous in scenarios where users are redirected after actions like logging in or completing transactions. To mitigate this risk, developers should implement strict validation rules to ensure that redirect targets are limited to trusted domains."
  impact: "The impact of the Django Open Redirect vulnerability can be severe, as it can facilitate phishing attacks and other malicious actions by redirecting users to harmful sites. Users may inadvertently disclose sensitive information, such as passwords or personal data, believing they are interacting with a legitimate application. This vulnerability can also lead to a loss of user trust and potential reputational damage for the affected organization. Ensuring robust validation of redirect URLs is essential to safeguard against these risks."
