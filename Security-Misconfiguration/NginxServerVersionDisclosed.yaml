info:
  name: Nginx Server Version Disclosed
  description: Detection of Nginx server version disclosure misconfiguration, potentially aiding attackers in identifying vulnerable versions.
  details: >
    The Nginx Server Version Disclosed test identifies a security misconfiguration where the Nginx server  version is disclosed in the response headers. The test checks if the response headers contain a version  string matching the regular expression "nginx/[0-9.]+". Disclosing the server version can aid attackers in  identifying potentially vulnerable versions and targeting specific exploits. This misconfiguration falls  under the Security Misconfiguration category with a low severity level. Concealing the server version in the
    response headers enhances security by reducing the exposure of potentially sensitive information.
  impact: Disclosing Nginx server version exposes potentially vulnerable versions, aiding attackers in identifying exploits and targeting specific vulnerabilities.
