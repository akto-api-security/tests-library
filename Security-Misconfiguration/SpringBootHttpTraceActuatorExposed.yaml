info:
  name: Spring Boot Http Trace Actuator Exposed
  description: Spring Boot Http Trace Actuator Exposed Misconfiguration.
  details: >
    The Spring Boot Http Trace Actuator Exposed misconfiguration occurs when the Actuator endpoint  responsible for tracing HTTP requests is accessible to unauthorized users. This misconfiguration
    can lead to security risks as sensitive information, including request traces, timestamps, user  principals, and session details, can be exposed. Attackers can gain insights into the  application's HTTP traffic patterns and potentially exploit vulnerabilities. It falls under the  Security Misconfiguration category with a low severity level. Proper access control and secure  configuration of the Actuator endpoints are necessary to prevent unauthorized access to HTTP  tracing information.
  impact: Exposing Spring Boot Http Trace Actuator can disclose sensitive HTTP request information, potentially aiding attackers in exploiting vulnerabilities.
