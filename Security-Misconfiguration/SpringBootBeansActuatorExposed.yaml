  description: Spring Boot Beans Actuator Exposed Misconfiguration.
  details: >
       The Spring Boot Beans Actuator Exposed misconfiguration occurs when the Actuator endpoint, which provides 
       information about application beans, is accessible to unauthorized users. This misconfiguration can lead to 
       potential security risks as sensitive information, such as bean details, dependencies, and scopes, can be 
       exposed. It falls under the Security Misconfiguration category with a low severity level. Proper access 
       control and secure configuration of the Actuator endpoints are crucial to prevent unauthorized access and 
       protect sensitive information.
  impact: Exposing Spring Boot Beans Actuator can lead to unauthorized access and disclosure of sensitive application information.
  remediation: "To address the exposure of Spring Boot beans via the Actuator endpoint, first, ensure that sensitive beans containing confidential information or critical functionality are properly secured. Configure Actuator endpoints to only expose necessary information, such as health and metrics, while excluding sensitive beans from the default exposure. Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to restrict access to Actuator endpoints, ensuring that only authorized users or applications can access sensitive data. Regularly review and update the Actuator configuration to align with security best practices and mitigate any potential risks associated with bean exposure.To address the exposure of Spring Boot beans via the Actuator endpoint, first, ensure that sensitive beans containing confidential information or critical functionality are properly secured.
