  name: "Apache Struts - ShowCase Application Exposure"
  description: "Apache Struts - ShowCase Application Exposure refers to a vulnerability in the default ShowCase application included with Apache Struts, where it may be exposed in production environments without proper security measures. The ShowCase application is meant for demonstrating Struts features but, if left accessible, can provide attackers with an entry point to exploit other vulnerabilities in the Struts framework. This can lead to unauthorized access, data leakage, or remote code execution. To prevent this risk, it's essential to disable or remove the ShowCase application in production environments."
  details: "Apache Struts - ShowCase Application Exposure occurs when the demo ShowCase application, bundled with Apache Struts, is deployed in production without proper security controls. This application demonstrates Struts' capabilities, but if left accessible, it can be exploited by attackers to probe for vulnerabilities within the framework or the server. Since the ShowCase often includes unsecured forms and endpoints, it increases the risk of attacks like remote code execution or unauthorized access. Organizations should ensure that demo applications are removed or securely disabled in production environments to minimize exposure."
  impact: "The impact of Apache Struts - ShowCase Application Exposure can be serious, allowing attackers to exploit vulnerabilities in the exposed demo application, potentially leading to remote code execution, unauthorized access, or data breaches. This exposure increases the risk of attackers gaining deeper access to the server and critical applications running on it. If exploited, it can result in service disruptions, loss of sensitive data, and reputational damage, as well as potential legal and regulatory consequences if compliance standards are violated."
