  description: "Searches for the pattern and log file on passed URLs."
  details: >
              "Git Credentials Disclosure refers to the vulnerability where the presence of Git credentials and log files is checked on provided URLs. The .git-credentials file contains sensitive information, including HTTPS URLs and authentication credentials. Promptly addressing this vulnerability is crucial to prevent unauthorized access, protect the integrity of source code, and safeguard sensitive information from being exposed."
  impact: "Disclosing Git credentials exposes sensitive information, including HTTPS URLs and authentication credentials, enabling unauthorized access to Git repositories and potential code manipulation."
  remediation: "To remediate Git credentials disclosure, start by reviewing the repository history to identify exposed credentials. Remove them using git filter-branch or BFG Repo-Cleaner, then enforce a .gitignore policy to prevent further commits of sensitive files. Encourage secure credential management practices to prevent future exposure."
