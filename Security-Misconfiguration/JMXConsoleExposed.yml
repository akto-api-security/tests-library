info:
  name: "JMX Console Exposure"
  description: >
    "The JMX (Java Management Extensions) console exposure vulnerability occurs when the management console is accessible over the network without proper authentication or restrictions."
  details: >
    "When the JMX console is exposed, it allows unauthorized users to access sensitive management functionalities of the Java application server. This can include viewing system properties, accessing application configurations, and invoking methods on managed beans (MBeans), potentially leading to privilege escalation or exposure of sensitive data."
  impact: >
    "Exposing the JMX console can significantly increase the risk of unauthorized access and manipulation of the application server. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary operations, potentially compromising the integrity and availability of the application. Proper authentication and access controls are essential to mitigate these risks."
