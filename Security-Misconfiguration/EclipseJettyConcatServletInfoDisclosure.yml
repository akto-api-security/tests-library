info:
  name: "Eclipse Jetty ConcatServlet Information Disclosure"
  description: "This vulnerability occurs when the ConcatServlet feature in Jetty is improperly configured, potentially exposing sensitive information. This servlet is used to concatenate multiple files into a single response. If not properly secured, attackers can gain unauthorized access to internal server files, revealing confidential data such as server configurations or source code."
  details:  "This vulnerability affects versions of Jetty that enable the ConcatServlet feature without adequate access controls. Attackers can exploit this misconfiguration to send specially crafted requests that retrieve unintended files from the server's file system. This can lead to exposure of sensitive data, including configuration files and application code, which could facilitate further attacks or compromise the server's integrity."
  impact: "The impact of this vulnerability is significant, as it allows attackers to access sensitive files from the server's file system. This unauthorized access can lead to the exposure of configuration settings, source code, or other confidential information, potentially enabling further exploitation or attacks on the application and its underlying infrastructure. Ultimately, this may compromise the integrity and confidentiality of the affected system."
