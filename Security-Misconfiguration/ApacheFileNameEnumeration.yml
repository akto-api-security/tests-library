  name: "Apache Filename Enumeration Test"
  description: "This test refers to a security assessment conducted to identify potential vulnerabilities in an Apache server's configuration that may allow unauthorized users to enumerate or access sensitive files through predictable naming conventions. During this test, security professionals attempt to access various files using known patterns or extensions, checking if the server improperly reveals directory contents or file structures. This type of enumeration can lead to the exposure of sensitive information, such as configuration files, backups, or scripts. To mitigate these risks, it's essential to implement proper access controls, disable directory listing, and secure sensitive files from public access."
  details:  "Apache Filename Enumeration Test involves systematically probing an Apache server to identify vulnerabilities that allow unauthorized access to files through predictable naming patterns or URLs. Security testers typically attempt to access known or common filenames, extensions, and directories to determine if the server is configured to expose sensitive files. Successful enumeration can reveal critical information, such as configuration files, database credentials, and backup files, which may be exploited by attackers. To safeguard against such risks, server administrators should ensure proper security configurations, restrict access to sensitive files, and implement error handling to prevent revealing information through server responses."
  impact: "The impact of an Apache Filename Enumeration Test can be substantial, as successful exploitation may lead to unauthorized access to sensitive files and information. Attackers could obtain critical data such as configuration files, API keys, or user credentials, which can facilitate further attacks on the system or network. Additionally, exposure of sensitive information can lead to data breaches, operational disruptions, and significant financial losses for the organization. Furthermore, the reputational damage and potential regulatory penalties resulting from such vulnerabilities can have long-lasting effects on the organization’s trustworthiness and compliance standing."
