  name: "Docker APIs Exposure"
  description: >
    "Docker is a platform that enables developers to automate the deployment of applications inside lightweight, portable containers. It exposes a REST API for managing Docker containers, images, networks, and volumes. If these APIs are improperly secured, they can be exploited by attackers."
  details: >
    "Exposed Docker APIs can allow unauthorized users to manage containers and images on the host system. This includes the ability to create, start, stop, or delete containers, pull images from repositories, and even execute commands within running containers. If the Docker API is accessible over the network without proper authentication or access controls, it can lead to significant security vulnerabilities."
  impact: >
    "The exposure of Docker APIs can result in severe consequences, including unauthorized access to containerized applications, disruption of services, data exfiltration, and potential compromise of the host system. Attackers could leverage these APIs to run malicious containers, escalate privileges, or gain access to sensitive data stored within containers. Proper authentication, network segmentation, and access control measures are critical to mitigating these risks."
