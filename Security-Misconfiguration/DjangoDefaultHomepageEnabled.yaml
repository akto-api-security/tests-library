  name: Django Default Homepage Enabled
  description: Detection of Django default homepage enabled misconfiguration, exposing sensitive information and indicating a potential security risk.
  details: >
    The Django Default Homepage Enabled test identifies a security misconfiguration where the default homepage
    of a Django application is accessible. The test checks if the response payload contains the string "The  install worked successfully! Congratulations!" which indicates that the default homepage is enabled. Having
    the default homepage accessible can expose sensitive information about the Django application, such as  version numbers and potentially sensitive file paths. This misconfiguration falls under the Security  Misconfiguration category with a low severity level. Disabling the default homepage in production
     environments is crucial to minimize information exposure and enhance security
  impact: Enabling the Django default homepage exposes sensitive information, indicating potential security risks and facilitating targeted attacks on known vulnerabilities.
