info:
  name: Laravel Debug Mode Enabled
  description: Laravel debug mode enabled misconfiguration can expose sensitive information, potentially leading to security vulnerabilities.
  details: >
    The Laravel Debug Mode Enabled misconfiguration occurs when the Laravel framework is  configured to run in debug mode, allowing detailed error information to be displayed in  responses. This can expose sensitive information, such as full file paths, database details,  and stack traces, to potential attackers. By analyzing the debug output, attackers can gain  insights into the application's internals and potentially exploit vulnerabilities. This  misconfiguration falls under the Security Misconfiguration category and has a low severity  level. Disabling debug mode in production environments is essential to prevent information  disclosure and enhance the application's security posture.
  impact: Enabling Laravel debug mode can expose sensitive information, increasing the risk of security vulnerabilities and potential attacks.
