info:
  name: "Apache Apollo Default Login Vulnerability"
  description: "The Apache Apollo Default Login vulnerability involves the use of default credentials for accessing the Apollo messaging broker. If these default usernames and passwords are not changed during installation, attackers can exploit this weakness to gain unauthorized access to the system. This can lead to the manipulation of message queues, interception of messages, and exposure of sensitive data. To mitigate this vulnerability, it is essential to change default credentials and implement strong authentication measures immediately after installation."
  details: "The Apache Apollo Default Login vulnerability occurs when installations of the Apollo messaging broker are left with default credentials, such as admin/admin. This oversight can allow unauthorized users to log into the system and access its administrative functionalities. Attackers exploiting this vulnerability can manipulate message queues, intercept messages, and potentially gain access to sensitive information. To prevent such risks, it is crucial for administrators to change default credentials and enforce strong password policies during the setup process."
  impact: "The impact of the Apache Apollo Default Login vulnerability can be substantial, as unauthorized access to the messaging broker can lead to serious security risks. Attackers could manipulate or delete messages, intercept sensitive communications, and gain insights into internal systems and processes. This breach can compromise data integrity and confidentiality, potentially leading to data leaks and significant reputational damage for the affected organization. Implementing strong access controls and changing default credentials are critical to mitigating these threats."
