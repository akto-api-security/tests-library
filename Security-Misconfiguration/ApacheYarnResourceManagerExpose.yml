info:
  name: "Apache Yarn Resource Manager Exposure"
  description: "This test refers to the unprotected access of the Yarn Resource Manager interface, which manages and allocates resources in a Hadoop cluster. When exposed to the internet without proper security measures, unauthorized users can gain access to critical cluster management functionalities and metrics. This vulnerability can lead to unauthorized resource manipulation, data theft, or disruption of services. To mitigate risks, it's essential to enforce strong authentication, use network restrictions, and secure the interface behind firewalls."
  details:  "Apache Yarn Resource Manager Exposure occurs when the Yarn Resource Manager interface is accessible without adequate security controls, such as authentication or IP whitelisting. This exposure allows unauthorized users to view sensitive resource allocation details, monitor running applications, and potentially modify cluster settings or configurations. Attackers could exploit this access to launch denial-of-service attacks or manipulate resource allocations to disrupt Hadoop operations. To protect against this exposure, organizations should implement strong access controls, use encryption, and restrict access to trusted IP addresses or networks."
  impact: "The impact of Apache Yarn Resource Manager Exposure can be substantial, as unauthorized access may allow attackers to manipulate resource allocations and disrupt critical Hadoop operations. This could lead to performance degradation, denial of service, and potential data loss if resources are mismanaged or maliciously altered. Additionally, attackers gaining insight into cluster metrics and configurations could exploit vulnerabilities in running applications, resulting in further security breaches and significant financial and operational repercussions for the organization."
