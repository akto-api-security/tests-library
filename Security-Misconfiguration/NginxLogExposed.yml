info:
  name: Nginx Log Exposed
  description: >
    "Nginx log exposure occurs when server log files are accessible through web requests. This can lead to information disclosure of sensitive data such as internal server errors, file paths, IP addresses, and other diagnostic messages that should not be accessible to the public."
  details: >
    "Logs like Nginx's `error.log` or `access.log` may contain sensitive information such as request details, server configurations, file paths, and internal errors. If these log files are accessible via the web, attackers can exploit this information to plan more targeted attacks or identify vulnerabilities."
  impact: >
    "Exposure of log files can result in sensitive data leakage, such as IP addresses, request headers, file paths, and stack traces. This information can be used to exploit vulnerabilities in the web application, compromise user privacy, or lead to further attacks on the server infrastructure."
