  description: "Exposed SSH Known Hosts"
  details: >
              "Identifies publicly accessible SSH known_hosts files, which store fingerprints of SSH servers. Unintentionally exposing these files can disclose information about previously accessed SSH servers."
  impact: "Exposing SSH known_hosts files enables attackers to gather information about previously accessed SSH servers, increasing the risk of unauthorized access and potential compromise."
  remediation: "To secure SSH known hosts, enforce strict permissions on the `known_hosts` file and its parent directories to prevent unauthorized access. Regularly review and validate the entries in the `known_hosts` file to remove outdated or unauthorized host keys. Utilize host key verification mechanisms to detect and mitigate potential man-in-the-middle attacks. Consider implementing centralized SSH key management solutions and automated host key rotation to enhance security and simplify administration."
