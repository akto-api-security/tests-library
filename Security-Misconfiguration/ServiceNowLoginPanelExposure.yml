info:
  name: "ServiceNow Login Panel Exposure"
  description: "This test refers to the unintended accessibility of the ServiceNow platform's login interface over the internet without proper security measures. This exposure can enable unauthorized users to attempt login via brute force or credential stuffing attacks, potentially gaining access to sensitive incident management and IT service data. To mitigate these risks, it is crucial to implement strong authentication, enforce IP restrictions, and secure the login panel behind firewalls."
  details: "ServiceNow Login Panel Exposure occurs when the login interface for the ServiceNow platform is left open to public access without adequate security controls, such as multi-factor authentication or network restrictions. This vulnerability allows attackers to target the login panel with brute force attacks, trying to compromise user accounts, especially if weak passwords are in use. To protect against this exposure, organizations should enforce strong password policies, utilize account lockout mechanisms, and restrict access to the login panel from trusted IP addresses only."
  impact: "The impact of ServiceNow Login Panel Exposure can be serious, as unauthorized access may allow attackers to gain entry to sensitive IT service management data, incident records, and user information. This could result in data breaches, unauthorized modifications to service requests, and potential disruptions to business operations. Furthermore, compromised accounts could be used to escalate privileges and launch further attacks on connected systems, leading to significant financial and reputational damage to the organization."
