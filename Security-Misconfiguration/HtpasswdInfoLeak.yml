info:
  name: "Htpasswd Information Leak"
  description: The '.htpasswd' file or related htaccess configuration files can be exposed due to improper server configurations. This file may contain sensitive information such as hashed passwords for user authentication.
  details: The '.htpasswd' file is a part of the Apache server configuration used for basic authentication. If improperly protected, attackers can directly access this file through the web server, potentially allowing them to acquire  user credentials (hashed passwords) and target further attacks by cracking  the hashes or launching brute force attacks.
  impact: Unauthorized access to sensitive authentication credentials. Increased risk of password cracking or brute-force attacks. Compromised user accounts and potential data breaches. Reputation damage and regulatory penalties.
