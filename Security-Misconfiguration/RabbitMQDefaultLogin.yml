id: RABBIT_MQ_DEFAULT_LOGIN
info:
  name: "RabbitMQ Default Login"
  description: >
    "This vulnerability arises when RabbitMQ's default credentials are not changed, allowing unauthorized access."
  details: >
    "RabbitMQ ships with a default username and password, typically 'guest' for both. If these credentials are not modified, anyone with network access can authenticate and gain full access to the management interface, which may include sensitive information and administrative controls."
  impact: >
    "Using default credentials can lead to unauthorized access, allowing attackers to manipulate message queues, read sensitive data, and potentially disrupt services. It is crucial to change these credentials to maintain security and prevent unauthorized exploitation."
