info:
  name: "KubeView Information Disclosure"
  description: "This vulnerability involves the unintended exposure of sensitive information in the KubeView application, which provides a web-based interface for Kubernetes cluster management. This issue arises due to improper handling of data, which allows unauthorized users to access sensitive details about the cluster’s configuration and resources. Exploiting this vulnerability can lead to information leakage, potentially compromising the security and privacy of the Kubernetes environment. Ensuring proper access controls and data protection measures is essential to address this risk."
  details: "This vulnerability is due to insufficient access control and data exposure within the KubeView application. Attackers can exploit this flaw to retrieve sensitive information, such as Kubernetes cluster configurations, resource details, and other potentially confidential data. This exposure can occur through improperly secured API endpoints or web interface components. Addressing this vulnerability involves implementing stricter access controls and ensuring sensitive data is adequately protected."
  impact: "The impact of this vulnerability is significant, as it allows unauthorized users to access sensitive information about the Kubernetes cluster. This could include configuration details, resource information, and other critical data, potentially aiding attackers in planning further exploits or compromising the cluster. The exposure of such information can lead to increased risk of unauthorized access and potential breaches within the Kubernetes environment. Immediate action to secure the application and protect sensitive data is essential."
