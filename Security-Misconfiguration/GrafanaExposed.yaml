  name: "Grafana Exposed"
  description: >
    "This vulnerability occurs when Grafana instances are accessible without proper authentication or authorization, exposing dashboards and sensitive configuration information."
  details: >
    "Exposed Grafana instances can allow unauthorized users to view and interact with dashboards, potentially leading to the exposure of sensitive data visualizations, database connections, and metrics. This can occur due to misconfigurations in network security settings or when services are inadvertently made publicly accessible."
  impact: >
    "The exposure of Grafana can result in unauthorized access to critical monitoring and logging data. Attackers could gain insights into the system architecture, performance issues, or sensitive business metrics, which could be exploited to perform further attacks or disrupt services."
