id: PHPMYADMIN_PANEL_EXPOSURE
info:
  name: "phpmyadmin Panel Exposure"
  description: "This test refers to the unprotected access of the phpMyAdmin interface, a popular tool for managing MySQL databases, making it reachable over the internet without proper security measures. This exposure can allow unauthorized users to attempt to log in, potentially gaining access to sensitive database information, executing malicious queries, or altering data. To mitigate risks, it's essential to implement strong authentication, use IP whitelisting, and secure the panel behind firewalls."
  details: "phpMyAdmin Panel Exposure occurs when the phpMyAdmin interface is accessible to the public without sufficient security controls, such as robust authentication mechanisms or restricted IP access. This vulnerability can enable attackers to attempt brute force login attempts, gaining unauthorized access to MySQL databases. Once inside, they could execute harmful SQL queries, delete critical data, or extract sensitive information. To protect against such exposure, administrators should enforce strong passwords, implement multi-factor authentication, and limit access to trusted IP addresses."
  impact: "The impact of phpMyAdmin Panel Exposure can be catastrophic, as unauthorized access may allow attackers to manipulate, delete, or extract sensitive data from MySQL databases. This could lead to data breaches, loss of critical information, and disruptions to business operations. Additionally, attackers might leverage the compromised interface to escalate privileges or compromise other connected systems, resulting in significant financial and reputational damage to the organization."
