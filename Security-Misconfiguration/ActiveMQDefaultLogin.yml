info:
  name: "ActiveMQ Default Login"
  description: >
    "This vulnerability arises when ActiveMQ's default credentials are not changed, allowing unauthorized access."
  details: >
    "ActiveMQ ships with a default username and password. If these credentials are not modified, anyone with network access can authenticate and gain full access to the management interface, which may include sensitive information and administrative controls."
  impact: >
    "Using default credentials can lead to unauthorized access, allowing attackers to manipulate message queues, read sensitive data, and potentially disrupt services. It is crucial to change these credentials to maintain security and prevent unauthorized exploitation."
