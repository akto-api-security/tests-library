id: PHPFASTCACHE_PHPINFO_EXPOSURE
info:
  name: "phpfastcache phpinfo Resource Exposure"
  description: "This vulnerability involves unauthorized access to sensitive information through the phpinfo() function in the phpFastCache library. This exposure can reveal critical server configuration details, environment variables, and file paths, potentially aiding attackers in further exploiting the system. Without proper access controls, the information can be leveraged to compromise the application and its underlying infrastructure. Regular updates and proper configuration are essential to mitigate this risk."
  details: "The vulnerability arises when the phpfastcache library is improperly configured, allowing the phpinfo() function to be accessed by unauthorized users. This function displays comprehensive information about the PHP environment, including loaded extensions, configuration settings, and server details. Attackers can exploit this exposure to gather information that could facilitate attacks, such as identifying version-specific vulnerabilities or accessing sensitive files. Proper access controls and security measures are crucial to prevent unauthorized access to this information."
  impact: "The impact of the phpfastcache phpinfo resource exposure can be significant, as unauthorized access to detailed PHP configuration information may allow attackers to identify weaknesses in the system. This information can aid in crafting targeted attacks, exploiting version-specific vulnerabilities, or accessing sensitive data stored on the server. Ultimately, this exposure increases the risk of further security breaches, data theft, and system compromise. Mitigating this vulnerability is essential to protect the integrity and confidentiality of the application."
