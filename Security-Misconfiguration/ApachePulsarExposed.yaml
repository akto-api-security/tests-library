info:
  name: Exposed Apache Pulsar
  description: >
    Exposure of Apache Pulsar services can lead to unauthorized access to messaging and streaming data. This vulnerability occurs when Pulsar's administrative interfaces or APIs are not properly secured.
  details: >
    When the Apache Pulsar admin REST API is exposed without adequate authentication or access controls, attackers can gain access to sensitive information, manipulate topics, or modify configurations. This could allow for data leakage, message interception, or service disruption.
  impact: >
    Unauthorized access to the Pulsar administration API can result in critical security risks, including data breaches, loss of integrity of messaging systems, and potential denial of service. Proper security measures, including IP whitelisting and strong authentication, should be implemented to protect these services.
