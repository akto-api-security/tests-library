info:
  name: "Kafka Metadata API Exposed"
  description: >
    "The Kafka Metadata API provides access to sensitive metadata about Kafka clusters, topics, and configurations. If exposed without proper security measures, it allows unauthorized users to query metadata about topics, brokers, and configurations, potentially leading to sensitive information disclosure."
  details: >
    "The Kafka Metadata API is used to retrieve metadata about Kafka clusters, including details about topics, brokers, configurations, and more. When this API is improperly exposed or insufficiently protected, unauthorized users can access this metadata, which may include internal system details or configurations. Such exposure can be exploited to gather information about the Kafka infrastructure, making it easier to plan further attacks or compromise the system."
  impact: >
    "Exposing the Kafka Metadata API can lead to unauthorized access to critical information about the Kafka infrastructure, including topic configurations, broker details, and internal system settings. This information could be used by attackers to perform targeted attacks, manipulate Kafka clusters, or disrupt the messaging system. In a worst-case scenario, it could lead to data breaches, system outages, or exploitation of downstream services."
