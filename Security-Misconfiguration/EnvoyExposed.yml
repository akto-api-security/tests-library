  name: "Envoy Configuration Exposure"
  description: >
    "Envoy Proxy, a popular edge and service proxy, provides an administrative interface that can be used to access internal configurations. If improperly exposed, this interface may leak sensitive details, including routing rules, cluster configurations, listener details, and secrets."
  details: >
    "Envoy's admin interface provides access to configuration and operational data for the proxy, including the ability to view current configurations, network statistics, and logs. If the administrative interface is exposed without proper authentication, an attacker can retrieve sensitive configuration details, which may include backend services, cluster setups, and security configurations such as SSL certificates. Accessing these configurations could enable attackers to launch further attacks on the internal network or disrupt service operations."
  impact: >
    "Unauthorized access to the Envoy admin interface can lead to exposure of critical configuration information, enabling attackers to gain insight into internal network structures and services. This could lead to service disruptions, data leaks, or further exploitation of internal services. Sensitive configurations, such as SSL certificates or backend routing rules, could also be accessed and abused."
