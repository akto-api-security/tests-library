  description: "GraphQL debug mode enabled vulnerability exposes sensitive debug information, increasing the risk of data leakage and potential security breaches"
  details: >
    GraphQL debug mode enabled vulnerability refers to a security risk that arises when the  debug mode in GraphQL is left enabled in production environments. Debug mode is intended  for development and debugging purposes, providing detailed error messages and stack traces  to aid in troubleshooting. However, when enabled in a live production system, it can expose  sensitive information to potential attackers. The detailed error messages may inadvertently  disclose implementation details, internal system paths, or sensitive data, increasing the risk  of data leakage and potential security breaches. To mitigate this vulnerability, it is crucial  to disable debug mode in production environments and ensure that only essential error messages  are exposed to clients. Regular security audits and secure coding practices should be employed to protect sensitive information.
