id: JETTY_STATS_EXPOSED
info:
  name: "Jetty Stats Exposed"
  description: >
    "This vulnerability occurs when the Jetty server's statistics endpoint is exposed without proper access controls."
  details: >
    "The `/stats` handler provides detailed information about the server's performance, including the number of requests, errors, and active connections. If this endpoint is accessible without authentication or authorization, it can lead to information disclosure that could aid an attacker in planning an exploit or performing reconnaissance."
  impact: >
    "Exposing Jetty stats can lead to potential security risks by revealing internal metrics and operational data. Attackers can leverage this information to identify weaknesses, such as high error rates or resource exhaustion, and can plan targeted attacks based on the server's performance and usage patterns."
