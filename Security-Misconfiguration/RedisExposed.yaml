info:
  name: Exposed Redis
  description: >
    Exposure of Redis services can lead to unauthorized access to stored data and operations. This vulnerability occurs when Redis instances are accessible from the public internet without adequate security measures.
  details: >
    When Redis is exposed without proper authentication and network access controls, attackers can potentially connect to the Redis server. This access can allow them to execute commands, read sensitive data, or modify database contents. It is crucial to restrict access to trusted networks and implement authentication to protect Redis instances.
  impact: >
    Unauthorized access to Redis can lead to severe consequences, including data breaches, loss of data integrity, and potential denial of service. Security best practices, such as using strong passwords, configuring firewalls, and employing secure connections, should be enforced to safeguard Redis deployments.
