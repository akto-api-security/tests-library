info:
  name: Struts Debug Mode Enabled
  description: "Struts debug mode enabled misconfiguration can expose sensitive information, potentially leading to security vulnerabilities."
  details: >
    The Struts Debug Mode Enabled misconfiguration occurs when the Apache Struts framework is  configured to run in debug mode, allowing detailed debugging information to be displayed in
    error responses. This can expose sensitive information, such as stack traces, internal  paths, and configuration details, to potential attackers. By analyzing the debug output,  attackers can gain insights into the application's structure and potentially exploit  vulnerabilities. This misconfiguration falls under the Security Misconfiguration category  and has a low severity level. Properly disabling debug mode is crucial to prevent 
     information disclosure and enhance the overall security of the application.
  impact: "Exposing Struts debug mode can disclose sensitive information, increasing the risk of security vulnerabilities and potential attacks."
