  name: "WADL File Exposure"
  description: "This test refers to the unintended public accessibility of the Web Application Description Language (WADL) files, which describe the resources and services provided by a RESTful web application. If these files are exposed without proper security measures, they can reveal detailed information about the application's endpoints, methods, and parameters to unauthorized users. This exposure can increase the risk of targeted attacks by providing attackers with insights into potential vulnerabilities. To mitigate these risks, organizations should implement access controls and secure WADL files behind authentication mechanisms."
  details: "WADL Exposure occurs when the WADL files, which outline the RESTful web services of an application, are publicly accessible without sufficient security controls. This can allow unauthorized users to view detailed information about available endpoints, including their operations, parameters, and data formats. Such exposure can be exploited by attackers to identify vulnerabilities within the application, making it easier to execute targeted attacks or unauthorized operations. To safeguard against this exposure, developers should ensure proper access controls and restrict visibility of WADL files to authorized users only."
  impact: "The impact of WADL Exposure can be substantial, as unauthorized access to WADL files allows attackers to gain detailed insights into the application's architecture and available services. This information can facilitate targeted attacks, such as exploiting vulnerabilities or performing unauthorized operations on the API. Additionally, exposed WADL files may lead to data breaches or manipulation of sensitive information, resulting in significant operational disruptions and potential financial losses. Organizations may also face reputational damage and compliance issues if exposed data includes personally identifiable information (PII) or other sensitive data."
