  description: Flask Debug Mode Enabled Misconfiguration.
  details: >
         The Flask Debug Mode Enabled misconfiguration occurs when the debug mode is enabled in a Flask
          application. Debug mode is a development feature that provides detailed error messages, 
          interactive consoles, and other debugging capabilities. However, enabling debug mode in a 
          production environment can expose sensitive information and introduce security risks. 
          Attackers can exploit debug mode to gain unauthorized access, execute arbitrary code, or 
          obtain sensitive configuration details. This misconfiguration has a low severity level and 
          falls under the Security Misconfiguration category.
  impact: Enabling Flask debug mode in a production environment exposes sensitive information and introduces security vulnerabilities to potential unauthorized access and code execution.
  remediation: "To mitigate the risk of Flask debug mode being enabled, ensure it's disabled in production by setting the `debug` attribute to `False` in your Flask application configuration. This prevents detailed error messages from being exposed to users. Regularly review your application's settings to confirm debug mode remains disabled, as it can inadvertently expose sensitive information. Additionally, enforce strong input validation and error handling to enhance security even when debug mode is disabled."
