id: RABBIT_MQ_EXPOSED
info:
  name: "RabbitMQ Exposed"
  description: >
    "This vulnerability occurs when RabbitMQ's management interface is accessible over the public internet or insecure networks without proper authentication."
  details: >
    "Exposed RabbitMQ instances can allow unauthorized users to access the management interface, where they can view sensitive data, manage queues, and perform administrative actions. This exposure typically happens due to misconfigured firewalls, lack of network segmentation, or improper access control settings."
  impact: >
    "An exposed RabbitMQ instance can lead to unauthorized access, potential data loss, message manipulation, and service disruption. Attackers could exploit this access to compromise the integrity of message queues, resulting in significant operational impacts. Securing the management interface is essential to protect against these risks."
