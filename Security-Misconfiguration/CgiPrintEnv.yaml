  description: "A test CGI script on the server leaks a list of server environment variables in the response page."
  details: >
              "CGI Script Environment Variable refers to a vulnerability where a test CGI script on the server unintentionally exposes a list of server environment variables in its response page. These variables may include sensitive information like database paths, SSL configuration, remote IP addresses, and server administrator details. The leakage of such information can provide attackers with valuable insights into the server's configuration, potentially aiding them in planning targeted attacks. Addressing this misconfiguration promptly is crucial to prevent unauthorized access and protect the confidentiality of sensitive information."
  impact: "Exposing server environment variables through the CGI script increases the risk of targeted attacks, unauthorized access, and compromise of sensitive data and system integrity."
  remediation: "To secure CGI scripts against environment variable disclosure, carefully validate and sanitize input data to prevent injection attacks. Additionally, restrict the environment variables available to CGI scripts by setting appropriate configurations in the web server's configuration file (e.g., Apache httpd.conf). Limit the exposure of sensitive data by configuring the web server to only pass necessary environment variables to CGI scripts and avoid passing sensitive information directly through environment variables. Regularly monitor and audit the usage of environment variables within CGI scripts to detect and mitigate any potential security risks."
