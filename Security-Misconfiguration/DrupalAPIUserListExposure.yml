info:
  name: "Drupal JSON API Username Listing Endpoint Exposure"
  description: "This test refers to the unintended accessibility of a JSON API endpoint in Drupal that lists user information, including usernames. If this endpoint is exposed without proper security controls, unauthorized users can access sensitive user data, which may lead to privacy violations and potential account enumeration attacks. To mitigate this risk, it is crucial to implement authentication, authorization checks, and restrict access to sensitive endpoints."
  details: "Drupal JSON API Username Listing Endpoint Exposure occurs when the endpoint that provides a list of usernames is accessible to the public without adequate security measures, such as authentication or permission checks. This vulnerability can enable attackers to enumerate valid usernames, making it easier to target accounts for brute force or phishing attacks. Additionally, exposure of this information could lead to privacy breaches, as it reveals the existence of user accounts within the system. To safeguard against this risk, developers should ensure that proper access controls are implemented for sensitive API endpoints."
  impact: "The impact of Drupal JSON API Username Listing Endpoint Exposure can be significant, as unauthorized access to usernames allows attackers to compile a list of valid accounts for further exploitation. This can lead to increased risks of brute force attacks, phishing attempts, or social engineering, as attackers may target specific users with tailored attacks. Additionally, the exposure of user data can result in privacy violations and reputational damage for the organization, along with potential regulatory repercussions if sensitive information is mishandled."
