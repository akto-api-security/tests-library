info:
  name: "Broken Function Level Authorization - Vertical Privilege Escalation test 
  with GET method"
  description: > 
    "In this test, attackers exploit weaknesses in user privilege verification 
    by using HTTP GET requests to access higher-level functionalities. By 
    manipulating URL parameters or endpoint identifiers, they bypass 
    authorization controls to gain unauthorized access to privileged 
    resources or actions. This vulnerability can lead to unauthorized 
    data exposure, system compromise, and potential escalation of user 
    privileges within the application."
  details: >
    "In this test, attackers leverage vulnerabilities in user privilege checks 
    to elevate their access within an application. By manipulating parameters 
    in GET requests, they attempt to access functionalities typically 
    restricted to higher privileged users. This technique enables 
    unauthorized users to exploit weaknesses in authorization controls, 
    potentially accessing sensitive data or performing privileged actions."
  impact: >
    "The impact of this test can be significant. Attackers can exploit this 
    vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to privileged functionalities, 
    leading to data breaches, system compromise, and unauthorized actions. 
    This can result in the exposure of sensitive information, compromise of 
    user accounts, and damage to the organization's reputation and trust."
  remediation: "To remediate vulnerabilities exploited via HTTP GET requests, implement robust server-side authorization checks for all endpoints. Validate user permissions before processing requests and avoid relying on client-side controls for access management."
