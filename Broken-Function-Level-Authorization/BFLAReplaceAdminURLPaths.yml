# BFLA test by escalating privilege with concatenating admin keywords with URL subpaths for new path identification
id: BFLA_REPLACE_ADMIN_IN_URL_PATHS
info:
  name: "Broken Function Level Authorization - Vertical Privilege Escalation test 
  by replacing URL subpaths with admin keyword for new URL path identification"
  description: > 
    "In this test, attackers manipulate URL paths by replacing URL subpaths 
    with "admin" keywords to access privileged functionalities. This tactic 
    aims to bypass access controls and gain unauthorized entry to 
    administrative features or sensitive data. By exploiting this 
    vulnerability, attackers can escalate their privileges within the 
    system and potentially compromise its security."
  details: >
    In this test, attackers exploit weaknesses in function level authorization by 
    replacing URL subpaths with keywords like "admin" to access privileged 
    functionalities. By replacing specific subpaths, they attempt to 
    bypass access controls and gain unauthorized entry to administrative 
    features or sensitive areas of the application. This tactic aims to 
    escalate privileges within the system, potentially compromising its 
    security and allowing for unauthorized access to critical resources."
  impact: >
    "The impact of this test can be significant. Attackers can exploit this 
    vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to privileged functionalities, 
    leading to data breaches, system compromise, and unauthorized actions. 
    This can result in the exposure of sensitive information, compromise of 
    user accounts, and damage to the organization's reputation and trust."
  remediation: "To remediate URL path manipulation vulnerabilities, enforce strict server-side authorization checks for all requests regardless of URL structure. Implement a whitelist of permissible URL patterns and ensure that access control checks cannot be bypassed by altering URL paths."
