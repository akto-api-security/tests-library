  name: "Broken Function Level Authorization - Basic test without modifying HTTP methods for Vertical Privilege Escalation"
  description: >
    "Broken Function Level Authorization occurs when an application fails to adequately verify a user's privileges before executing a specific function. In a  Basic test scenario, without modifying HTTP methods, Vertical Privilege  Escalation can be attempted by accessing endpoints intended for higher  privilege users without proper authorization. This vulnerability  enables unauthorized users to exploit functionalities meant for  privileged users, potentially escalating their access within the system."
  details: >
    "In Broken Function Level Authorization - Basic test, attackers exploit  inadequate user privilege verification, accessing functionalities beyond  their authorization. Without altering HTTP methods, they target endpoints  reserved for higher privileged users, attempting Vertical Privilege  Escalation. This tactic allows unauthorized users to gain access  to sensitive functionalities, potentially escalating their privileges within  the system."
  impact: >
    "The impact of Broken Function Level Authorization without modifying HTTP  methods can be severe. Attackers can gain unauthorized access to  sensitive functionalities, manipulate critical data, or even perform  malicious actions reserved for higher privileged users. This could  lead to data breaches, system compromises, and significant damage to  the organization's reputation and integrity."
