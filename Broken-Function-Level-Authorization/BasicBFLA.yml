  name: "Broken Function Level Authorization - Basic test without modifying HTTP methods 
  for Vertical Privilege Escalation"
  description: > 
    "Broken Function Level Authorization occurs when an application fails to adequately 
    verify a user's privileges before executing a specific function. In a 
    Basic test scenario, without modifying HTTP methods, Vertical Privilege 
    Escalation can be attempted by accessing endpoints intended for higher 
    privilege users without proper authorization. This vulnerability 
    enables unauthorized users to exploit functionalities meant for 
    privileged users, potentially escalating their access within the system."
  details: >
    "In Broken Function Level Authorization - Basic test, attackers exploit 
    inadequate user privilege verification, accessing functionalities beyond 
    their authorization. Without altering HTTP methods, they target endpoints 
    reserved for higher privileged users, attempting Vertical Privilege 
    Escalation. This tactic allows unauthorized users to gain access 
    to sensitive functionalities, potentially escalating their privileges within 
    the system."
  impact: >
    "The impact of Broken Function Level Authorization without modifying HTTP 
    methods can be severe. Attackers can gain unauthorized access to 
    sensitive functionalities, manipulate critical data, or even perform 
    malicious actions reserved for higher privileged users. This could 
    lead to data breaches, system compromises, and significant damage to 
    the organization's reputation and integrity."
