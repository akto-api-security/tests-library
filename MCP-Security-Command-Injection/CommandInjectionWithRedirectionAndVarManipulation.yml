  name: Command injection by using Redirection and Variable Manipulation (MCP)
  description: Command injection by using redirection and variable manipulation involves
    exploiting input vulnerabilities to redirect command outputs or alter environment
    variables. This can allow attackers to execute unintended commands or access sensitive
    information by manipulating how commands are executed or how their results are
    handled. Effective input validation and secure handling of environment variables
    are crucial to prevent such exploits.
  details: '"Command injection via redirection and variable manipulation involves
    injecting malicious commands that use redirection operators or modify environment
    variables. Attackers can redirect outputs to files or other commands, or alter
    variables to change command behavior. This manipulation can lead to unauthorized
    command execution or exposure of sensitive data. Properly sanitizing inputs and
    securely managing environment variables are essential to mitigate these risks."

    '
  impact: The impact of command injection via redirection and variable manipulation
    can be severe, enabling attackers to execute arbitrary commands or redirect sensitive
    data. This can result in unauthorized access, data breaches, and system compromise.
    The manipulation of environment variables or command outputs can lead to significant
    security vulnerabilities and operational disruptions, making robust input validation
    and secure variable handling crucial.
