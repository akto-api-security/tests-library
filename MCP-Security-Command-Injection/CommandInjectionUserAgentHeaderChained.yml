  name: Command injection in User-Agent Header with Chained system instructions (MCP)
  description: Command injection in the User-Agent header with chained system instructions
    involves exploiting vulnerabilities in how an application processes HTTP headers.
    Attackers inject malicious commands into the User-Agent header, which are then
    executed in conjunction with other system instructions. By chaining these commands,
    attackers can execute complex operations, manipulate system behavior, or gain
    unauthorized access, exploiting improper handling of HTTP headers to compromise
    system security.
  details: '"Command injection in the User-Agent header with chained system instructions
    exploits vulnerabilities in the processing of HTTP headers. Attackers inject malicious
    payloads into the User-Agent header, which the application processes and executes
    alongside additional chained commands. This can involve manipulating header values
    to bypass security checks or execute harmful commands. The chaining of commands
    allows attackers to perform a series of operations, potentially leading to unauthorized
    access, data breaches, or system compromise."

    '
  impact: The impact of command injection in the User-Agent header with chained system
    instructions can be significant, as it allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands
    by exploiting HTTP header vulnerabilities. This can lead to unauthorized access,
    data breaches, or system compromise by executing a sequence of malicious commands.
    The ability to chain commands through the User-Agent header enhances the attackâ€™s
    complexity and potential severity, increasing risks to system integrity, confidentiality,
    and availability.
