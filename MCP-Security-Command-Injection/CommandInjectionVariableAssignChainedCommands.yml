  name: Command injection by variable assignment with chained system commands (MCP)
  description: Command injection by variable assignment with chained system commands
    involves exploiting vulnerabilities to inject commands through environment or
    shell variable assignments. Attackers can set variables with malicious values
    or commands, which are then executed in conjunction with other chained commands.
    This technique allows for complex, multi-step attacks by manipulating variable
    contents and chaining commands, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data
    breaches, or system compromise.
  details: '"Command injection by variable assignment with chained system commands
    exploits vulnerabilities to inject malicious commands through environment variables
    or shell variable assignments. Attackers can set variables to include harmful
    commands or data, which are then executed when the variables are used in subsequent
    chained commands. By manipulating these variables and chaining them with other
    commands, attackers can perform complex operations, bypass security filters, and
    execute unauthorized actions, leading to potential data breaches, system modifications,
    or privilege escalation."

    '
  impact: The impact of command injection via variable assignment with chained commands
    can be significant, as it enables attackers to execute malicious commands by exploiting
    variable assignments. This can result in unauthorized access, data manipulation,
    or system compromise. By injecting harmful commands into variables and chaining
    them, attackers can bypass security controls, alter system configurations, and
    execute complex sequences of operations, leading to data breaches, system instability,
    and escalated privileges.
